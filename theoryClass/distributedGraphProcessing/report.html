<h2 id="1-graph-analysis-overview-and-introduction-of-pgxd">1. Graph Analysis Overview and introduction of PGX.D</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graph analysis is a powerful method in data analysis. Normally, we can summarize any analysis process into 3 steps
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Gather data from it immediate neighbor (vertices that directly share an edge)</li>
<li>Step 2: Compute using gatherd data</li>
<li>Step 3: Update its new value and send it out to neighbor vertices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To able to improve graph processing performance, we need to first understand some of its characteristics:
<ul>
<li>The size of the graph is very large – larger than the capacityof a single machine’s main memory.</li>
<li>Many small-sized random memory accesses over the wholegraph instance are performed, especially during neighborhood iterations and graph traversals</li>
<li>The computation-to-communication ratio is low</li>
<li>There is a large degree of inherent parallelism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And also, problems with most of the graph processing frameworks:
<ul>
<li><code>Network overload</code></li>
<li><code>Load Balancing</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although several frameworks have been proposed for processing large graph instances in distributed environments, their performance is much lower than using efficient single-machine implementations provided with enough memory. In this report, we will get more insight about PGX.D, a fast  distributedgraph  processing  system. The result in the paper shows that  PGX.D outperforms other distributed graph systems like GraphLab significantly (3x – 90x). Furthermore, running PGX.D on 4 to 16 machines is also  faster  than  an  implementation optimized for single-machineexecution</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-pgxd-overview-design">2. PGX.D Overview Design</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overall, PGX.D try to improve process efficiency by combining multiple methods about <code>Task Management</code>, <code>Data Management</code> and <code>Communication Management</code>. Here in this report, we will mainly forcus on techniques to solve <code>Network overload</code> and <code>Load Balancing</code>. Though in the paper, there are plenty of technical techniques helps to speed up the process, but they are out of scope for this report.</li>
<li>Overview structure of a slave note. Each  machine  is  loaded  with  fairly  large  amounts  of  memory  aswell as many CPU cores, and the machines are connected by modern high-bandwidth, low-latency networks
<ul>
<li><img src="file:////home/anhvu/gitRepo/myINIAD/theoryClass/distributedGraphProcessing/img1.png" alt="alt text"></li>
<li>The graph algorithm is decomposed into numerous small task that can run in parallel (Each task in charge of some vertice)</li>
<li>Whenever a task reads or writes graph data, it checks withthe <code>Data Manager</code> which knows the location of the data. If the data resides in the current machine, the access is immediately resolved; otherwise,  the  Data  Manager  buffers  up  the  request  into  a  large request message</li>
<li>The blocked tasks are resumed when the response messagefor the corresponding request message comes back</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="21-to-solve-network-overload">2.1. To solve <code>Network Overload</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>When loading the graph from very beginning, each vertice is labeled with a 64-bit number which concatenates the machine number and the local offset for that particular vertice. In that way, <code>Data manager</code> can immediately known location of any vertice.</li>
<li>PGX.D has both <code>pull data mode</code> and <code>push data mode</code>
<ul>
<li><code>pull data mode</code>: When a vertice needed data from its immediate neighbors, it can pull data from them</li>
<li><code>push data mode</code>: When a vertice complete its computation, can can send result to immediate neighbors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using buffer to reduce network traffic. Request only be sent when message buffer has reached its maximum size or the worker thread has completed all task</li>
<li>Using <code>Selective Ghost Node</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Selective ghost node creation</code> is a technique to choose a set of high-degree vertices and to duplicate ghost copies of them on each machine. <code>Ghost Nodes</code> are selected at loading time (using in-degree and out-degree)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="22-to-load-balancing">2.2. To <code>Load Balancing</code></h3>
<ul>
<li>PGX.D use <code>Edge Partitioning</code> to load balance. That is, each slave node is given equally number of edges
<ul>
<li><img src="file:////home/anhvu/gitRepo/myINIAD/theoryClass/distributedGraphProcessing/img2.png" alt="alt text">.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In detail, before partitioning the graph, PGX.D first computes the total sum of in-degrees and out-degrees for all <a href="http://vertices.It">vertices.It</a> then chooses the pivot vertices that result in a balanced sum of in-degrees and out-degrees for each partition.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-evaluation">3. Evaluation</h2>
<ul>
<li>To evaluate, PGX.D is applied to run numbers of algorithm on 4 big graph data:
<ul>
<li><img src="file:////home/anhvu/gitRepo/myINIAD/theoryClass/distributedGraphProcessing/img3.png" alt="alt text"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result:
<ul>
<li><img src="file:////home/anhvu/gitRepo/myINIAD/theoryClass/distributedGraphProcessing/img4.png" alt="alt text"></li>
<li><img src="file:////home/anhvu/gitRepo/myINIAD/theoryClass/distributedGraphProcessing/img5.png" alt="alt text"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overall, we can conclude that PGX.D is significantly faster than other framework.</li>
