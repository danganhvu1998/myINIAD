# Star Network and Ring Network Comparation

## Abstract

![alt text](./report1.png)
It is very clear that in network topology, a `ring network`(RN) will have a better tolerance when link error occur over a `star network`(SN). When a link error occur, immediately, a part of SN is disconnected to the rest, while 2 link errors is needed for a part of RN to be disconnected. But of course, there is many downside of RN over SN as well. Next we will consider two network aspect over RN and SN: `packet lost rate` and `network congestion`

## Objective

We want to compare SN with RN over 2 aspects: `packet lost rate` and `network congestion`. In here, we expect SN will have a better perfomance in both in consideration aspects. Though experiment, we want to test the theory purposed above, and also gain deeper look into it.

## Experiment

### Packet Lost Rate
