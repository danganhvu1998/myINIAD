Here are some points that I found interesting in Simon's presentation about the content of the talk, what should be in, and what should be let out:
    1. Try to give everyone in the audience something variable after the talk, even if they are not the specialist in the talk's area. Also, every often, your audience is far from perfect: they do not know you very well, are not familiar with the topic, sometimes even already tired. So as the speaker, it is important to find a way to wake them up within 2 minutes after the speech begins. 
    2. There are only 2 things that should be in the speech:
Motivation: A quick summary of what is the speech about. This is at the very beginning of the talk and should be the part to wake up the audience before they start to doze. It is a good point to note that should not go into a long rift like "I am glad to be here". Points should be / can be included in:
What is the problem?
Why it is interesting?
The key idea: After the motivation, you should talk about the key idea of the talk. Here, it is important to make sure about the audience has no doubt about what is your talk about. To abe to do that, you should be absolutely specific, try to avoid a wide and shallow talk, but instead try to deliver a narrow and deep one. 
Try to use examples as it is your main weapon. Not a universal fact, but very often that people in their leaning, move from specific to general. And yet, a lot of presents go from general to specific. So go with the example is a very good way to help the audience to understand what you are trying to explain. In detail, good examples can have the following effects:
To convey the basic intuition
To show extreme cases
To illustrate the idea
etc
Should not present too many technical steps as it is too understand for the audience, and as a result, they just simply skip it. Try to think of another way to deliver technical detail instead of just throwing it to the audience. Too much is not good, but non at all is also a bad practice. 
Should also not put outline, and related work. It can distract the audience, make them confused. And normally, the outline has zero information in it. 

Not just the content, the way to present the idea is also important. To be able to deliver the best talk, here are some points that I found important:
Be enthusiasm:
If you are not enthusiastic about the topic, why should the audience?
Make the audience easier to accept the idea
Remember your slide. It should be fresh in your memory, and you should always know what is the next slide. This helps to avoid some bad practices like reading the script or facing your back to the audience.
Do not apologize, the audience has no idea what to do with it.
Finish on time.
