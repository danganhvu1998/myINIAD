If the  local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order  pizza, Im no worse off than I am now, and I dont have to worry about local kids or nosy neighbors.

It doesnt  make them secure, by any means, but a wall, even if the FBI can get a master  key by court order, is still better than a \"keep off the grass\" sign.  &gt; The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldnt.

(a) To use for sensitive but not strategically important traffic, (b) if the system was cheap.  For example, I dont own a cordless phone.  With Clipper, I would.  If the  local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order  pizza, Im no worse off than I am now, and I dont have to worry about local kids or nosy neighbors.  That is to say, Clipper \"raises the bar\" on insecure channels.  It doesnt  make them secure, by any means, but a wall, even if the FBI can get a master  key by court order, is still better than a \"keep off the grass\" sign.  > The answer seems obvious to me, they wouldnt.
