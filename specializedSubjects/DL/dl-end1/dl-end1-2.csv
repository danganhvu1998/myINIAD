Rather than fix the code and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it.   - Jonathan   ",1,sci.space

However, the rumors >I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter >seems more likely.  Yo Ken, lets keep on-top of things! Both the ""External Tank"" and ""Wingless Orbiter"" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list. Todays (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports that OConnor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped, such as using the ""giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles,"" and building a ""station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.""  Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in todays Times).  Option ""A"" - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside, there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this option  -  Uses ""Bus-1"", a modular bus developed by Lockheed thats      qualified for STS and ELVs. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C      Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this      for the Air Force.   -  A ""Power Station Capability"" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.      SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle      flies in an ""arrow mode"" to optimize the microgravity environment.      Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power      source for 30 day missions.   -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term      of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the      US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing      SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International      Partners labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The      Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.      The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.   -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and      add another 20 kW of power   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,      the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return      Vehicle).  Option ""B"" - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option ""B"" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we have all come to know and love :)  This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option ""A""). Also, the  number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit, for both options ""A"" and ""B"".  The build-up occurs in six  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power      is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when      it visits.   -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist      language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is      deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.   -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by      keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes      there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the      second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).   -  A ""Two Fault Tolerance Capability"" is achieved after 14 flights,      with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal      control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.   -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,      the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the      assembly in 24 flights.  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option,  with the exception of the data management system, which has major changes.  Option C - Single Core Launch Station. This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter cylinder thats 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on the backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a  regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket motors, and launch the can. Some key features  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout   - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels   - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against     micrometeroid & orbital debris)   - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)   - 7 berthing ports   - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet     (twice the volume of skylab).   - 7 floors, center passageway between floors   - 10 kW of housekeeping power   - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal     loops, dual environmental control & life support system)   - increased crew time for utilization   - 1 micro-g thru out the core module ",1,sci.space

" UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES      Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below     would be welcome.    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.       ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into     Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20     Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas     scintillation proportional counters.       CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint     NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian     system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini     is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.     After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon     arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an     orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens     Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of     Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours     while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the     surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter     continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and     targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the     mission are    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturns     satellites, and characterize Titans atmosphere and surface.      One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain     down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to     peer through Titans clouds and determine if there is liquid on the     surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.      The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the     first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of     Saturns satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan     atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan     Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true     nature of Saturns rings.

MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire     surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity     map.       MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.     Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in     transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for     one martian year (687 days).       TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched     8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the     TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.       ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over     its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.      Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of     the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from     that planet by sliding over Jupiters north pole in a gravity-assist     manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Suns south pole     in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its     perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- thats right, a solar-studies spacecraft     thats always further from the Sun than the Earth is!      While in Jupiters neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and     radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see     *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

If you assume new launcher development, with lower costs as a specific objective, then you probably dont want to build something HLV-sized anyway.  Nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy Titans.  It doesnt take many Titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large gas gun or a development program for a Big Dumb Booster, all of which would have far better cost-effectiveness.

" SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE      SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM      Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,     and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version     of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)     periodically there. The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE     archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly     included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or     the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming     missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.      Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news     frequently.       WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?      The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).      The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102, 	""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is 	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower 	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program) 	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a 	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other 	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort 	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of 	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining 	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target 	in second stage.""      This really is a good answer, but its couched in NASA jargon. Ill try     to interpret.      1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.      2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack 	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the 	""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line 	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly 	negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of 	""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z 	direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading."" 	We have to be careful about those wings -- theyre about the 	most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.      3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more 	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or 	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be 	the case if we didnt roll (""performance gain"").      4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated 	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort 	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver 	complexity"").      5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio 	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio 	antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").      6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a 	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.      7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is 	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east 	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity 	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction. 	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its 	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.      This all begs the question, ""Why isnt the launch pad oriented to give     this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to     achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers     from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one     for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main     Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime     launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top""     [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented     basically the same way they were for the Saturn Vs.  (A side    Saturn Vs also had a roll program.  Dont ask me why -- Im a Shuttle     guy.)      I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll     maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons     stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total     maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element     array.       HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT      NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite     dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72     degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed     over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from     California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.     shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite     for these viewers.      If you cant get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.     Its worth asking if yours doesnt.      The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is     frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press     conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle     missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying     much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions     are not being covered.

Does that make Soderstroms shutouts less impressive because of > Torontos lack of offense?  YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**. Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if youre a coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didnt see the second Toronto game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasnt tested. The same for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel doesnt have a game like that in him.  > Well if you look back to November when Roussel was the #1 goalie (Soderstrom > was being treated for his heart ailment).

Actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel reserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift astronaut or something like that).

Somebody has to build that thruster module; its not an off-the-shelf item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include attitude control (HSTs own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro data from HSTs own gyros to an external device), and separation (you dont want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like).  The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was relatively short, so it got cancelled. --  SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry ",1,sci.space

Directly I mean...  In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in hassles.  The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you dont have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project. --  All work is one mans work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry ",1,sci.space

" The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to  make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.   Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming  feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is  more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to  understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education  whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday  would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data  Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didnt know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.  All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.  			John. ",1,sci.space
"  Tom Barrasso wore a great mask, one time, last season.  He unveiled it at a game in Boston.    It was all black, with Pgh city scenes on it.  The ""Golden Triangle"" (Pghs downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top, along with a steel mill on one side and the Civic Arena (I think) on the  other.   On the back of the helmet was the old Pens logo (the really fat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) Pens logo, and a space for the ""new"" (now current) logo.  Tommy had designed the mask, and his mother (an artist) painted it for him.    But while wearing the mask, the Pens got thumped by the Bruins.  The very next game, Tommy was back to the old paint job.  A great mask done in by a goalies superstition.  Lori   ",0,rec.sport.hockey

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced to give it up (Ramseys now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike Foligno (whos now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who retired, so I guess thats where the streak started.  Or did it? After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit. Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so Im not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I dont know if the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)  Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign youre to be traded, almost, unless youre a franchise player.  --  Valerie Hammerl			Birtday -(n)- An event when friends get  hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu	together, set your dessert on fire, then acscvjh@ubms.cc.buffalo.edu	laugh and sing while you frantically try  v085pwwpz@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu  to blow it out.

We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger    in and of it self did not uncover flaws.  2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is    not dependent on ""sophisticated tools""  (CASE tools?).  However, tools    cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle    Language) is somewhat limited.  3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated ""Level 5"" by a NASA team.    This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.  4. Feel free to call me if you or your organization is interested in more info    on our software development process.

" 1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes. ----------------------------------------- *Stauber disturbed by third-man theme by Rick Sadowski, Daily News  Barry Melroses decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender.  ""I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most fun time of the year, and Im not,""  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  ""I think I have worked hard enough for that.""  Stauber said he accepts Melroses choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays 6-3 opening victory.  But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.  Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was  yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasnt played since March 29.  Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudeys backup again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic Saddledome popcorn.  ""If Im supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?""  Stauber wondered.  ""Not that Id be happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs.""  Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.  While insisting he is the Kings ""goalie of the future,"" Melrose said Stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were, according toYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to  Vancouver on Thursday.  ""Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didnt do it,"" Melrose said.  ""An elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a great goalie is that he isnt satisfied to be a backup.""  ""Im not blaming Robb for the losses, but if youre going to be No. 1, youve got to be able to walk your talk.  Youve got to be able to play when everything is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect more from him than he does.""  Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the team hit a mid-season slump, didnt play for a month after Knickle was signed off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.  ""I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,"" said Stauber, a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only  to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.  ""What Ive been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldnt be here.""  ""Anybody who would disagree with that doesnt know me.  Im not saying Barry  doesnt know me, but dont say Ive been without expectations.  If anything, Im a perfectionist.""  Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. ""But  even though I didnt play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? Its  a bit of a jump,"" he said.  ""Youre almost No. 1, or if you play a good game  youre No. 1 and if you dont youre No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67  and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  Thats what barry wanted me to explain  to him, why I didnt come through when he counted on me.  I dont know. What I  do know is, its a sport.  Ill be there.""  Melroses ""goalie of the future"" statement doesnt mean much to Stauber. ""Before you know it, Ill be 30 and there will be no future,"" he said.  ------  *Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC  Channel 7 here in LA.

A truly great GM would have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can maintain the teams success but cant push them to the next level.  In the history of hockey there have been several better GMs than Murray- way too many to name.  Murray isnt even the best GM in the league today. He fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and Quinn in my estimation.  I cant imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen in hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GMs.  Gregmeister ",0,rec.sport.hockey

Nice try Deepak, but ""tough Whaler squad"" should have clued you in to the fact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.  If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really rather be playing golf, dont really give a damn.  Of course I cant say this for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I dont think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically human attitudes.    With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing  money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff ""take"" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are going to come back with ""winning spirit"" and all of that crap but these players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the  game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make a decent living.   Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is  being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.  The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top  after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and ""hot"".  The  emphasis on the playoffs, with their ""sudden death"" appeal has been promoted by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.

" From the article ""Whats New"" Apr-16-93 in ........ WHATS NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC  1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE ""SPINOFFS"" WE WERE PROMISED? In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published ""The Man Who Sold the Moon,"" which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this  hideous vision of the future.  Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with ""SCHWARZENEGGER"" painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged for the ad to promote Arnolds latest movie. Now, Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However, since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates (WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs. ..........  What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore. What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).

" HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT      First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA     announcement.      Q. How do I become an astronaut?      A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since its probably     impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying     passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have     so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that youre better off hoping to     win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet     experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you     want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle ""mission     specialist"".      If you arent a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,     the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly     exceeds the supply.  NASAs problem is not finding qualified people,     but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough     to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,     many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.      Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands     dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer     programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-     seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in     another seems to be a frequent winner.      Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a     radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows     what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term     effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other     significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,     you should be okay; if you cant, your chances are poor.      Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in     appearance and actions; youve got a tough selling job ahead, trying     to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you     are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you     will be a credit to NASA after you are    a significant part of the job, and NASAs image is very prim and     proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.     Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,     and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.     Keep your nose clean.      Get a pilots license and make flying your number one hobby;     experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.      Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,     43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were     a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).     If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job     at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you     do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first"".      Think    to demonstrate motivation.      Keep trying.  Many astronauts didnt make it the first time.         NASA     National Aeronautics and Space Administration     Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center     Houston, Texas      Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates     ==================================================================      Astronaut Candidate Program     ---------------------------      The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for     Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates     to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a     continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.      Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be     considered.      All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in     Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation     program.      Space Shuttle Program Description     ---------------------------------      The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated     that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming     routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in     the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then     returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and     flight crew.      The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment     and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation     of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials     processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will     eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space     station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher     orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space     Shuttles capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include     government agencies and private industries.      The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,     and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are     assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA     astronauts.      Pilot Astronaut      Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.     During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,     crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the     commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the     pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing     the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other     payload operations.      Mission Specialist Astronaut      Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,     have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations     in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and     experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to     have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed     knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and     objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the     experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission     specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling     using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific     experimental operations.      Astronaut Candidate Program     ===========================      Basic Qualification Requirements     --------------------------------      Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to     submitting an application.      Mission Specialist Astronaut     1. Bachelors degree from an accredited institution in engineering,     biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be     followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,     professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be     substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (masters     degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic     preparation is important.      2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a     civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following     specific 	 Distant visual	      20/150 or better uncorrected, 	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.  	 Blood	      140/90 measured in sitting position.      3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.      Pilot Astronaut     1. Bachelors degree from an accredited institution in engineering,     biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be     followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,     professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of     academic preparation is important.      2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight     test experience highly desirable.      3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a     military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following     specific 	 Distant visual	      20/50 or better uncorrected 	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.  	 Blood	      140/90 measured in sitting position.      4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.      Citizenship Requirements      Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of     the United States.      Note on Academic Requirements      Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic     education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelors     degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,     biological science, physical science, or mathematics.        The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the     sciences, are not considered      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology, 	Medical Technology, etc.)       - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological 	Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).       - Degrees in Nursing.       - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)       - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.      Application Procedures     ----------------------      Civilian      The application package may be obtained by writing 	NASA Johnson Space Center 	Astronaut Selection Office	Houston, TX 77058      Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA     decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be     given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is     made. Applications received after that date will be retained and     considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually     of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate     continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants     who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from     consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the     preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be     requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as     supervisors and references may be contacted.      Active Duty Military      Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their     respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application     procedures will be disseminated by each service.      Selection     ---------      Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required     for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.     Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered     will be notified of the outcome of the process.      Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the     selection of additional candidates during a one year period following     their establishment.      General Program Requirements      Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be     assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,     Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and     evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or     scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to     ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut     training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills     required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot     astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during     their candidate period.      Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does     not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut     will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and     evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the     training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become     permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for     a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not     selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA     depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that     time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a     specified tour of duty.      NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified     minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.     Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.      Pay and Benefits     ----------------      Civilians      Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal     Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,     and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements     and experience.      Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and     participation in group health and life insurance plans.      Military      Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center     but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and     other similar military matters.",1,sci.space

" Hi,     I was reading through ""The Spaceflight Handbook"" and somewhere in there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to the sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very long-winded but heres my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration? Can this be extended to larger accelerations?  Thanks is advance... -Amruth Laxman  ",1,sci.space

You could set up a bitmap with a mask in it.  Clear the bitmap, draw the rectangle to be deleted with GXor.  Draw the one that is to stay with GXclear.

" Im trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band boxes in Motif/X.  Im running on an 8-bit display for which Ive created a colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  I want to draw the lines in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which Im displaying a bitmap using XPutImage().  If doesnt matter if the lines I draw interactively stay around when the window is refreshed.  Currently, to draw interactively, I begin    /* drawIndex is an colortable index I reserve for the Foreground */    /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */    palette_colors[drawIndex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;    palette_colors[drawIndex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;    palette_colors[drawIndex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;    XStoreColors( myDisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[DrawIndex], 1);    XFlush( myDisplay);     XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXxor);    XSetForeground( myDisplay, gc, drawIndex);  Then to draw I    XDrawLine( myDisplay, XtWindow( drawingArea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);    XFlush( myDisplay);  And when Im all done, to return things to normal I    XSetFunction( myDisplay, gc, GXcopy);   What Id like to happen is for the lines I draw to be the inverse of whatever Im drawing over.  Instead what happens is I get white lines.  If the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  If the lines are over a black area - nothing shows up!  Its very strange.  But the GXxor function seems right - since if I do a rubber-banding box, it erases and redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).

" In article <1radsr$att@access.digex.net> prb@access.digex.com (Pat)      What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?  Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates were seeing an edge to the distribution.     Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are    quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?     Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?     Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...) 	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromedas bursters. 	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is ""the edge of the Universe"" ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.  	If we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS theyd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]     my own pet theory is that its  Flying saucers  entering    hyperspace :-)     but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they    are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered    if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

""I am extremely honored to have been selected to lead this important review panel. Americas future in science and technology and as a world leader in space demands our utmost attention and care,"" said Vest. ""We have assembled a diverse panel of experts that, I believe, will bring the appropriate measures of insight, integrity and objectivity to this critical task.""  The advisory committee is charged with independently assessing various redesign options of the space station presented by NASAs redesign team, and proposing recommendations to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the space station program.

Why cant a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great beyond of space? what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is not.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church  stating which was Portugals and what was Spains, and along came the Reformation and made it all null and void..   What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what ever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble.. Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but cant for soem reason or another, but who will give you a ""home"".. Such as Saudia Arabia or whatever.. There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them and offer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it.. Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it. The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they will not care..  If your worried about the US, do the same thing..  Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what ever..

" I havent seen anyone post this so I will do the honors.  Maine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night.  It was quite a game. Maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away with it.  Maines first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game. LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.  LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards. The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game. LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second. Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.  Coach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won the game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie. The third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark. They were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by Paul Kariya.  The last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also proved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU goalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by both.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.  This years three championships games were sold out last year in about one month.  The Bradley Center holds approximately 17,700.    --  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ Douglas J.

It seemed pretty conclusive to me.  The puck clearly hit the crossbar and then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers, kept harping about how they ""must have had a different view upstairs"" because it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who saw the replay, that the puck didnt go in.  The referee originally  signalled no goal but the video replay ""judges"" initiated contact with the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is unheard of.

"  I have a problem where an Athena strip chart widget is not calling its get value function.  I am pretty sure this is happening because I am not using XtAppMainLoop, but am dealing with events via sockets.  (ya ya).  Anyway, I want to cause a timeout so that the strip chart widget(s) will call their get value callback.  Or if someone knows another FAST way around this (or any way for that matter) let me know.  I cannot (or I dont think) call the XtNgetValue callback myself because I dont have the value for the third parameter of the get value proc (XtPointer call_data).

Geez Allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and ""wrap"" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true. Which is it Allen?  >>>Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate.

You admit here that this is wrong. Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen.

Apollo integration was  done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for  Apollo?  >Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs.

They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.   >>Kinda funny isnt it that someone who talks about a problem like this is >>at a place where everything is overhead. >  >When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that >integration isnt overhead. It is the single most important part >of a successful large scale effort. >  I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.  There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this.  >>Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally >>demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being  >>selective with the facts again. >  >The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on >Congress. Suprise suprise.

" Even easier to implement than writing messages on the Moon, once upon a time a group of space activists I belonged to in Seattle considered a ""Goodyear Blimp in orbit"".  The idea was to use a large structure that could carry an array of lights like the Goodyear Blimp has.

Unfortunately, it appears that the NumLock mask varies : from server to server.  How does one tell what mask is numlock and : which are for Meta (Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask). : eg, SGIs vendor server has Mod2Mask being NumLock, whereas Solaris : 1.0.1 OpenWindows 3.0 has Mod3Mask for NumLock.  Is there an : unambiguous means of determining NumLocks mask at runtime for any : given server?  Sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.  Youll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each modifier. The one with NumLock in its mapping is the modifier you want. A bit ugly perhaps but I think its currently the only way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are  used to differentiate CapsLock from ShiftLock for the Lock modifier).  I dont know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous assignments either. (ie. what if NumLock is mapped for more then one modifier). I suppose first found is as good as any.  X doesnt handle locking modifiers that well.   Hope that helps,  Dave Lapp  Standard Disclaimer etc... ",2,comp.windows.x

The Itar-TASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos 2238 from  Plesetsk Cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payloads mission.

"   What are the Leafs to do?  I am a Leaf supporter and I say the Leafs are going down in four unless there is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits Pat Burns.  If you were Pat Burns what would you do?  Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage to pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate comments on the Leaf/Detroit 3rd line match-ups)  but here is the basic idea...  Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against  the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the hell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples skin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole. He used to be good at it.  We need him now.    Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroits second line. I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night. These guys are the ""swing"" players for the Wings.  Last year they did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour should be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a nasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.   Score Gilmour score!	      Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line 	      Torontos checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)  * as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up 		 and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However, 		if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their 		checking line against these ""finesse"" players - well then 		let them play.  ** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in. ** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either. ** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).  I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and out-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending or officiating.  This calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next Monday.   -jake.   GO LEAFS !!!    ",0,rec.sport.hockey

" As I promised, I would give you the name of the Panthers president. After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers.  A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_ Torrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as  persident and general manager of the New York Islanders. Throughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torreys bow ties have become as much of a signature as Andre Agassis hair.  The Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price  information in early next month.  In the meantime, Huizenga leaves the day-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP and GM.  The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Floridas NHL team to focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 Florida Panthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National  Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.  ""The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats,"" Torrey said.   ""Hopefully thats the way well play on ice.""  MoreIn Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four consecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president of the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play- offs in 1968, only their second NHL season.

I then have to click on the mouse button to actually place the window on the screen. Yet when I specify the -geometry  option the window appears right away, the properties specified by the -geometry argument. The question now How can I override the intermediary step of the user having to specify window position with a mouseclick? Ive tried explicitly setting window size and position, but that did alter the normal program behaviour.

There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans.  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.   Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some will object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an ""Americanization"" of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is ""American"" or not is irrelevant.   >If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not  >central to the original article.

Any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and when its fuel runs out it will crash within months.  The orbits of the Apollo motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few days.  It is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there -- the Moons gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.  Perturbations from Sun and Earth are relatively minor issues at low altitudes.  The big problem is that the Moons own gravitational field is quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the Moon. --  All work is one mans work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry ",1,sci.space

"   The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory, a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from Dimitri Yushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS never led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an NHL record 9th OT loss this season.  Roster Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched. Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-BrindAmour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-Hynes  Dominic Roussel  Game I didnt get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts I didnt have the best radio coverage either. Heres the box score followed by a few things I did pick First	Hartford, Nylander 10,	Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, BrindAmour),Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing),Har (interference) Second	Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron),	Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi),	Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson),Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har major-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping),Har (tripping), Third	Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels),	Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich),	Philadelphia, Faust 2 (BrindAmour, Roussel),Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping),	Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust),Penalties - None  Power	Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4	Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves) 	Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)  On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue line and Nylander stripped him and took off.  The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.  The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie.  On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in. This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if they get one shot and beat you fine. Dont give them another chance. Carkner, Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, Ill bet money at least one of them was the closest FLYER to the play.  Thats all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it was that scored, much less how.  From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (Im surprised that a former goalie wouldnt look closer at his defensive play), Tommy  Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark. But heres the odd part. He couldnt decide between Lindros and Recchi for number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between him and Lindros, doesnt that make Lindros #2????  What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...  #1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice. The difference between the teams record with him and without him is no accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the C on his jersey next season.  #2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour, and Tommy didnt have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didnt play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family has a history of heart problems). Theres no question in my mind that Tommy Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.  #3 Mark Recchi. Again, you cant argue with an all-time team high single season scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didnt have a single player get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season. Not a tough choice.  Honorablewhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasnt on the top line this year and didnt get as much playing time. Then again, he didnt get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.  Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling that with his shot hell score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone, and I suspect that hell be the teams top defenseman in years to come.  Garry Galley was the teams point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some things you just cant argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome, he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year.  Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total. But consistency became a problem for him.  A couple misc notes mostly for mailing list Tom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail addresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer. If youre interested, you can send him mail att!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK  The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as many goals as they allowed, 319.  The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.  I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have no other way of getting them.

Gretzky, Lemieux, Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman. They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If they were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive abilities.   When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing  apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isnt  very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of him.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type of player.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types of players- this includes defensive forwards.  When compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatest defensive forward ever.  He is the player whos talents best suited being a defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.  Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his offensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a better defensive forward, but he wasnt.  Bob Gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey.  Gregmeister ",0,rec.sport.hockey

They did some fine penely-killing in the first (2 men down for a couple of minutes at one point) but they just couldnt keep it  up.  They spent virtually the entire game either short-handed or just coming off a penelty -- as soon as theyd get re-grouped, theyre penalized again!   Sheesh -- like Gilmour said after the 1st -- you cant go calling  every little push an shove in a game like that.  And if youre going to, you have to do it for both teams.   Pearson (one of my four favorite Leafs) played like a bonehead -- I saw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities, and then he got that *bonehead* 5-minute major high-sticking penalty.   Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of games ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his line can smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clarks got to get tough -- hes got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left  wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will put some numbers on the board... and Pearson... heck, maybe he should be benched.   I hate to repeat Grapes, but where the heck was Foligno?  Zezel cant do all the checking himself -- and get MacLlwain on the move... we  need some speed out there!  Keep Potvin in net, he did okay  considering... although (like I said a couple weeks ago) Potvin  messed up in a couple games in the AHL playoffs last year -- he can  easily do it again.   My prediction last week was Toronto in 7 -- that the games DET wins  will be blow-outs and the game TOR wins will be close -- I still stand by that.   Dont fret, Leafs fans, in order to win in 7, the other team has to win 3! :-)   Burns is going to make some magic -- hell mix up some lines.  Match the Wings line-per-line.  Hell have his team checking hard, and hell never let them get out-numbered in their own end.  The Leafs will win Wednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the first one).

In his two starts and his relief effort for Beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp - dont forget the shutout.  I think hes let in just four goals over eight periods of play.

" Hello Motif World,  a few days ago I posted my announcement for an update of Motif++. I got several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and I know of several people who have been using Motif++, and there are probably a number of people I am not aware of who are also using Motif++.  My question How many people out there would be interested to join a mailing-list, where people can ask questions about Motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the bindings. This would benefit the user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to see added to Motif++. Motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this way I can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or changed.  If youre interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to reply to this message, and tell me so. When there is sufficient interest, say about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and I will post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups. --  Ronald van Loon     | In theory, there is no difference  (rvloon@cv.ruu.nl)  | between theory and practice. 3DCV Group, Utrecht |    The Netherlands     | In practice however, there is.

It turns out that the mask is custom-fit to the goalies face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltenders face.  Then, a plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12 minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the goalies face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.   John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.   >He exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on, namely, a >new mask for Andy Moog which is a basic re-working of his current >mask with the bear on it, and new mask for Bob Essensa which was  >*really* cool -- the Jets logo was on the chin, and there were two >fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air-brushed >back-ground.

" This might a real wierd idea or maybe not..  I have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them that then drys and makes hard walls...  Why not do the same thing for a space station..  Fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such, blow up the baloons, spin then around (I know a problem in micro gravity) let them dry/cure/harden? and cut a hole for the docking/attaching ring and bingo a space station..  Of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation protective covering/heat shield(?) and the material used to make the wals would have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paint/covering of the inner wall would have to be human safe.. Maybe a special congrete or maybe the same material as makes caplets but with some changes (saw where someone instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture, got a mix that was just as strong as congret but easier to carry around and such..)

" ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	The release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.  	Patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the  newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in  their source distributions of X11.  	People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has  23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line 		send fixes # where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.  	Here are a few	1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request ""5a"", ""5b"", ""5c"" and  ""5d"" separately 	2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was  re-released with patch 7 [	3) fix 8 is in two	4) fix 13 is in three	5) fix 16 is in two	6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which  previously was optional 	7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff by asking for ""PEXlib.uu.[1234]"". 	8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, ""22a"" through ""22i""  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail  it a request, and it mails back the response. 	Any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can  have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help).  The xstuff server treats the ""of the message. 	The archives are organized into a series of directories and  subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an  index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the  subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.  	1) The command ""help"" or ""send help"" causes the server to send you a  more detailed version of this help file. 	2) if your message contains a line whose first word is ""index"", then  the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then  the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index.  For example, you can say ""send index fixes"" (or ""index fixes""). A message that  requests an index cannot request data. 	3) if your message contains a line whose first word is ""send"", then the xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name  an item, you give its directory and its name. For example                 send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9 	You may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many  safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large  amounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the  days quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day.  Whenever the mailer is run to send its days quota, it sends the requests out  shortest-first. 	4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting  return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you wont get any response.  If  you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like         path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu or         path bar!foo!frotz in the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.  	The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. If  your mailer deals in ""!"" notation, try sending to  {someplace}!mit-eddie!expo.lcs.mit.edu!xstuff.

BackgroundX accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUS and Sun (and other vendors) VME systems.  That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display on a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port which can be used to provide additional displays. For example, say you hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You could put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system. You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to mix and match any combination of screens and displays. You could have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays, or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically any combination.  Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the use of the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite different in meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.  The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12 screens in a display. As it so happens, theres a define in the server that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h, MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek, this is 12.  As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e. X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of X Im sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this is not the case.  We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more.

In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000 and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops, British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here its hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there its hard to find a kid without a pair of skates.  And before you say ""what does he know? Hes from California."" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia, a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational hockey for about 35 years.  |> >When was the last time you saw a hockey league in the inner city. |> >The insurance alone is a big enough barrier. |>  |> The inner city isnt the only place that is poor. |> I think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ICE to play on.   Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended, cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.  By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the ""inner city"" areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood Citys rink is in an industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeleys is near Ashby and Martin Luther King, Stocktons is in Oak Park, Sacramentos is in an older section of downtown (I forget the name of the street), Fresnos is out on the edge of town, just west of 99.  Santa Rosas is a nice rink, but its in an older section of town. Dublins is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and include the resurfacing time in the fee.   --  Alan Hepburn           ""A man doesnt know what he knows National Semiconductor       until he knows what he doesnt know.""

IMO any good player should score on power plays because of the man advantage.  Very good power play scorers tend to become overrated because their point totals are inflated by power play points. +/- tends to expose these overrated players such as Brett Hull, John Cullen and Dave Andreychuck.  Given the opportunity to play power play consistently, any player can inflate his totals.  Gregmeister ",0,rec.sport.hockey

" #21	PETER AHOLA It is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had only played 50 games this season (I think its actually less; the San Jose Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasnt been spectacular, and his offense isnt anything to write home about (8 points); its even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn out to be ... Peter Ahola.  #24	DOUG WILSON		2nd round pick in 92 entry draft I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out. Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which, unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be Wilsons last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.  #29	DEAN KOLSTAD Its probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 hes quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games, he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.  #38	PAT MACLEOD MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that he wouldnt clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment, a ""rehab assignment"" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs. Since he has played so little, I cant even give a tentative grade on him, but he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive skills.  #41	TOM PEDERSON Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in 43 games.  However, his size (5 9"", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically, on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach. But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.  #45	CLAUDIO SCREMIN He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that will go down in Scremins entry of league stats is probably the fact that he was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.  =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!

What I like about GUI 	- The ability to view and manipulate a group of objects, files, 	  text, directories, etc. and and manipulate them in some way 	  such as delete, copy, paste, rename ...  	- The ability to have several applications / screens visible 	  and accessable at the same time.  	- Being able to do a standard set of functions easily and 	  quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. I am familiar with 	  the command lines of several operating systems but occasionally 	  I will have to some work on a system that I almost never use. 	  If it has a GUI, I can usually accomplish what I want to do 	  fairly easily, the command line on the other hand often is 	  a long and painful experience.   What I hate about GUI 	- Having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. I guess 	  I have a strong one-handed preference. I like to use a 	  computer with one hand and use the other for holding something 	  like a piece of paper of a mug of tea. I have configured my 	  favorite editor so that most of the editing functions can be 	  done with one hand such as navigating, cutting, pasting, 	  searching, opening and saving files, etc. The main thing I 	  need to use both hands for is entering text.  	I guess I need to get one of those mice with, like, 20 buttons 	or something and then I will have the best of both worlds.  						Brent  ",2,comp.windows.x

Yesterday I was able to watch FOUR games...the NJ-PITT atBUFF-BOS ateach series goes its max I could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd consecutive nights (I havent counted so thats a pure guess).  I have two tvs in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE and keep an eye on BOS-BUFF at the same time.  I did the same for the two afternoon games.  Btw, those ABC commentaters were great!  I was quite impressed; they seemed to know that their audience wasnt likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore and they did an excellent job.

There was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was found, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorperson did say something about a NASA official commenting that there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the SSRB.

I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out of town (in NM).  As for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work on SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have some. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.  Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.  Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made for spending half on DC.  Public support is STILL critical.

"  McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X          HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern California day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last Saturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket ship.          The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in mid-June.          Although there wasnt a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60 million for the DC-X -- cant itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies.          SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent changes in SDIs political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.          SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies, said Col.  Simon ""Pete"" Worden, SDIOs deputy for technology.  But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. ""I didnt make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend,"" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters.          While SDIO has lowered its sights on the programs orbital objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the ""better, faster, cheaper"" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that ""leapfrog"" ahead of evolutionary technology developments.          Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a ""build a little, test a little"" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how todays engineers could move beyond the ""miracles of our parents time.""          ""The key is management,"" Worden said. ""SDIO had a very light hand on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.""          Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. ""Its essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially.""          SDIOs approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. ""This is the direction were going to have to go,"" said Rep.  George Brown, the committees Democratic chairman. ""Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years arent sustainable....NASA hasnt learned it yet.  SDIO has.""          Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Browns Republican colleague, went further. Joking that ""a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"" Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency.          Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. ""Lets not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Lets build a spaceship!""           Although Rohrbacher praised SDIOs sponsorship, he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.          McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. ""On very large ventures, companies put in seed money,"" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas senior vice president for space systems. ""You need strong government investments.""          While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas Aircrafts DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).          Flight tests this summer at White Sands will ""expand the envelope"" of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet.          Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final tests will include a ""pitch-over"" manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.          The flight test series will be supervised by Charles ""Pete"" Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing. Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.          If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust          Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround.          Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union. The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.          The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has a technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible for the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.   ",1,sci.space
"  The difficulties of a high Isp OTVLong transfer times (radiation damage from VanAllen belts for both  the spacecraft and OTV Arcjets or Xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have to have either nuclear power source (messy, dangerous and source of radiation damage) or BIG solar arrays (sensitive to radiation, or heavy) that make attitude control and docking a big pain.  If you go solar, you have to replace the arrays every trip, with current technology. Nuclear power sources are strongly restricted by international treaty.  Refueling (even for very high Isp like xenon) is still required and] turn out to be a pain.  You either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation to do docking or    ( and refueling) .  You still cant do much plane change because the deltaV required is so high!  The Air Force continues to look at doing things this way though. I suppose they are biding their time till the technology becomes available and the problems get solved.  Not impossible in principle, but hard to do and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets, at least today.  Just a few random thoughts on high Isp OTVs.

Bussard, Journal of 	Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990  	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion 	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the 	    thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values 	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are 	    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, ""high-thrust"" 	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system 	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local 	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100 	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer 	    ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a 	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with 	    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows 	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in 	    Earth/moon space.  	""The QED Engine	Aerospace Flight Propulsion"" by Robert W.

Farnsworth/Hirsch 	    demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in 	    1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising 	    stability of the Soviet Tokamak.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion 	Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.  	    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron 	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times 	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma 	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds 	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities 	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and 	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm 	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure 	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically 	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power 	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens 	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the 	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages 	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I 	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob 	    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently 	    declared Kolocs PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one 	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather 	    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the 	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid 	    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]      ION 	Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE 	archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the 	SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in 	the 1960s and 70s.

But Ill never forget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home in the pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-net goal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowds reaction tell the story for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din ""Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!""

North-ame- ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better  skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldnt get so many  breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nnes speed accentuates because of clumsy defensemen.  I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars arent as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans are in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the class of his own).   Tommi ",0,rec.sport.hockey

I think that you are incorrect, Roger.  Patrick, Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming front office types.  Hence, they did help build the league, although they were not great players themselves.    	I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans, then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like a reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being uncomplicated, then lets do so.  Once we have them, they will realize what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something abotu the history of the game.     >The history of the names can be put rather succinctly.

No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy individual (from what I have heard).   	Also, isnt the point of ""professional"" hockey to make money for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming division after management people rather than players is adding insult (in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was deserved).     _______________________ Evan Pritchard --------  Number 1 or 9 depending on the hockey pool  ======================= epritcha@psych.uiuc.edu   ",0,rec.sport.hockey

 The tradition of the octopus started back in the 1950s. It was tradition to toss an octopus out on the ice during the first play-off games because you needed eight wins for Stanely Cup.  Today people toss octupi anytime it gets near the   play-offs. David   ,0,rec.sport.hockey
" (Detroit, April 19)  In a development that shocked most knowledgable observers, the Detroit Redwings scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en route to a 6-3 win over the best team in the NHL, the Toronto Maple Leafs.   The Leafs could not be faulted, as they completely dominated the inferior Detroit squad and clearly deserved to win. Only the biased officiating of Andy Van Hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior  visiting side prevented an all-out massacre of the Wings by the leagues best  team.

My beliefs, opinions, and expressions are strictly my own and do not represent or reflect any official or unofficial policies or attitudes of any other person or organization....   but.  I have heard that Ford Motor Company has (had) a recruiting bias toward engineers and away from computer science graduates.  The reasoning is supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements.  This is evidenced by the large number of CS people who are employed via contracts and are not brought on board except in special circumstances.  This is a generalization which obviously doesnt always hold true, but there are statistics.  Furthermore, most ""software engineering"" at Ford gets done by electrical engineers.  I know of 2 univerities that have merged the computer science department and the electrical engineering so that you can get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than programming.  But since my beliefs and opinions are merely figments of my distorted imagination I suppose I should keep it to myself.    ",2,comp.windows.x

" A few days ago I posted a question about trying to call a function which set up an X app multiple times.  It was pointed out that XtAppInitialize() should never be called more than once.  This helped.  However, I am still having some problems.  Below is a new little test program that more closely models my real program.  In the actual program, I am writing a library, callable from any other program.  This means that the first time the lib function is called, it must initialize things, and after that, it should just use the old stuff (still around because of static variables).  In the demo below, main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents the interface to the library function.  #include <X11/Xlib.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include <Xm/PushB.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h>  void bla(XtAppContext app, Widget top) {         Widget topone = top;		// in real prog, these are member vars         XtAppContext theapp = app;	// of a class         int junk = 0;         Display *dis = XtOpenDisplay(theapp, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, &junk,                                         NULL);          Widget box = XtVaCreateManagedWidget(""blaaa"", xmPushButtonWidgetClass,                         topone,                         XmNheight, 50,                         XmNwidth, 50,                         NULL);          XtRealizeWidget(topone);         for (int i=0;i<=25;i++)	// real prog returns when ""Exit"" button clicked         {                 XEvent event;                 XtAppNextEvent(theapp, &event);                 XtDispatchEvent(&event);         }         XtDestroyWidget(box);         XtCloseDisplay(dis); }  // SetItUp - should be called once only void SetItUp(XtAppContext *app, Widget *top) {         int junk = 0;         (*top)=XtAppInitialize (app, ""test"", NULL, 0, &junk, NULL,                 NULL, NULL, 0); }  // doit - some library function callable from the outside void doit() {         static XtAppContext app;	// use these every time called         static Widget top;          static int setup = 0;          if (!setup)         {                 SetItUp(&app, &top);                 setup = 1;         }         bla(app, top); }  // main - program which links to my library main() {         for (int i=0;i<=20;i++)         {                 doit();                 printf(""sleeping...\n"");//widget still on screen at this point                 sleep(5);         } }   The problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.

A NASA friend and I spent one    drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar wed need    to put the golden arches of a certain American fast food organization    on the face of the Moon.  Fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.  Hmmm. It actually isnt all that much, is it? Like about 2 million km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, its only a few tens of m^2 per burger that said organization sold last year). Youd be best off with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft). If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon. You might have to abandon the colour, though.  Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit unmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base to extract TiO2 (compound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bobs your uncle.  Ill do it for, say, 20 billion dollars (plus changes of identity for me and all my loved ones). Delivery date 2010.  Can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink vendors? Who else might be interested?  Would they buy it, given that its a _lot_ more expensive, and not much more impressive, than putting a large set of several-km inflatable billboards in LEO (or in GEO, visible 24 hours from your key growth market). Ill do _that_ for only $5bn (and the changes of identity).  Nick Haines nickh@cmu.edu ",1,sci.space

The first time I heard this piece of news was on the post game radio interview here in Jyvaskyla. That was the bronze medal game in the  SM-liiga which Tichonovs team Porin Assat (the Aces of townlost.  Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach), said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to take the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach where ever he goes. He definitely wont be coaching Assat anymore (after three? seasons). I dont know why.  Vasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team, produced many players to our national team. Assat wasnt a skilled team (IMHO) but they had the fighting spirit. After all, they butchered Jokerit in the playoffs and gave hard time to TPS, the champs. But Assat wasnt consistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat any team in the SM-liiga.  I am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said, he wants to be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate and decide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach but maybe theyll do some compromise.  Could somebody post more information about Vasili? I know he was coaching in the former Soviet league; teams, results?

The chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving dominance in the marketplace.  Most Ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced white lead pigment some decades ago.

Theres documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the X11R5 distribution.    Actually, I just finished writing a motif animation program... (take-lots-of-image-data-and-display-it-pretty-darn-fast). When using on-server pixmaps or shared memory, I had to insert a delay loop to keep it from going too quickly :). Testing both methods side by side, they were just about equal.    The advantage of SHM is that your X server doesnt grow to ridiculous sizes; but pixmaps can work over a network and *are* removed if your application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when debugging SHM apps).    Shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g. Ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments (~6) to be attached to a process at once; consequently, a redraw becomes XShmAttach();XShmPutImage();XShmDetach(); on Dec systems. And Decs 24 bit displays (like the ones I tend to use most often) dont seem to support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong?), and using pixmaps causes the X server to crash (failed mallocs), so one *has* to use the local unix domain socket (which really isnt that bad; one copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).    InGood Thing (minus SHM if running over a network), and let the user pick whatever feels fastest.    (I just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it :)    )Rob ",2,comp.windows.x

"  Tcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several Network General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy,  2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility, 4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely operated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual  manipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found  it 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for many protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle TCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily modified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.  Tcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and SunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump. It compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will need Motif 1.1 or better.  The following files are available for anonymous ftp from  ftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking  tcpview-1.0.tar.Z	tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z	Sun4 binaries tcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z	DEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries  What tcpview adds to- easier interface - enhanced protocol decoding - hex display of frame - capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt - can show ethernet addresses with manufacturers name - ethernet address host table - can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames - can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional 	processing.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1  New Now reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with -r, the  file type will be automatically detected.  Can now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.  The hex format has been changed.  New time options have been added.  Options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.  Bugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)  New-R	read Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin -ttt	prints delta times -tttt	prints times relative to the first frame -W	write a Sniffer save file (use with -w) -x	print frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.

SUGs emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible service and value-added to our members.  Last year, the SUG 1991 disk contained plug-and-play X11R4, 20MB of additional essential binaries, almost 200MB of Sun patches, fully-indexed archives of Sun-related net postings, priced at only $250.  Our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added as possible.  To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk set, the first containing whats ready and needed now, the second available later in 92, containing more SPARC binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks.  The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A. Bruce, contains a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members (and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  If you are not a SUG member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live within the US or $55 outside.  The SUG 1992.1 CDROM is an ISO 9660 disk (which means it can be used by PC, Macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a total of 543MB of material, X11R5 SOURCES AND CORE BINARIES (for SPARC) as of several weeks after the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the MIT contrib-0 distribution are included (109MB of material).

" I have attached a copy of an announcement I picked up during my trip to Moscow last week.  I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)   For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of its faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

" In article <1993Apr21.001555.1@aurora.alaska.edu> nsmca@aurora.alaska.edu   Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..    Why not??  Because to be any use as a nav point you need to know -exactly- where it is, which means you either nail it to something that doesnt move or you watch it all the time.  Neither of which is possible on a deactivated spacecraft.  Then you have to know exactly how far away from it you are; this may or may not be possible with the hardware on board.   Apart from which, there is absolutely no need for navigation beacons. -- Gregory Bond <gnb@bby.com.au> Burdett Buckeridge & Young Ltd Melbourne Australia    Knoxs 386 is slick.

I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri- helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about 2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU. If 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiters -- which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could get under Jupiters influence.  > Also, perihelions of Gehrels3>  > April  1973     83 jupiter radii > August 1970     ~3 jupiter radii  Where 1 Jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 AU.

" Hello        I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod.         My computer configuration with the X problem is as        486DX50/256/16RAM  running Esix 4.0.4         Wangtek AT-style interface 250 M tape drive.        I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and        inet utilities (tcp/ip).        I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly.    I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems.  However, if I try to access the tape drive while in X, the  machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the  tape, the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to  startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background  pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login  from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.   Ive contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4  server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also   claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I dont  need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get  XFree86 to work.  Im not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet  packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.   I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same  system.  If you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated.    One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  If this is true,  what direction should I look to resolve the conflict ?

"  Thein the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creats a Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> while the Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be ""Tek-term"") is active makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus to the Xterm (Im basing that statement on the fact that the border of the  Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top of Xterm.  If what Im describing isnt input focus, let me know.)    The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.  Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics  highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move  the Tek-term to the top.

If I understand your problem correctly, you want to have a way to send exposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib graphics on the window.  It sounds like you might want to send an exposure using XSendEvent and specifying a region. If you know the region you need to send the exposure, generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects, you can use XCreateRegion to create a region, XUnionRectWithRegion to add the new object polygons to the region, and then either use the region to clip your GC for the redraw or use XRectInRegion to test which of your other objects need to be redrawn.

You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the windows depth doesnt match its parents.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is anotherCopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, Im not entirely certain its possible for Xlib to catch this.)  					der Mouse  				mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu ",2,comp.windows.x

For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.       Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters.       When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it, ""defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.""  Well Dr. Rachtin -- youve made us mad!  What are these principles that SSRT defies?       Well Ill tell you.  It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the ""fact"" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars.       It took some of the last generations experts to teach us some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Brauns first rocket was not a Saturn V.  General Schrievers ICBMs didnt take ten years to demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didnt cost $1 billion.       It took one of the great engineers of the 1950s to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better, cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960s.  Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little, Test a little.       Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We didnt solicit a bunch of requirements -- theyd just change every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as ""Shape Shifter"" than ""Space Lifter.""  We didnt spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  Whens the last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didnt take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that hed get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule.       As I described what SSRT is -- and isnt keep in mind its only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget.       Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might(See charts)       Im embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950s and 1960s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that cant see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth!       But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land horizontally, etc, etc.       I say to you -- well see you at White Sands in June.  You bring your view-graphs, and Ill bring my rocketship.  If we do what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

" Dear Its a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program,  Xavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews.  Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class library that adds multimedia capability to InterViews. It allows composite multimedia objects to be built from media objects.  Specifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available in InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the source code for the original classes (though several configuration files for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file).    Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN workstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.  Xavier has been tested in the following  Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC   OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later   C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1  NEC(EWS):   Machine : EWS4800/210,230   OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2   C++     : C++ Release3.1  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from            interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/           (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)  We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.

" Im working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding  standard colormaps.  The X11R5 documentationthese colormaps.""  I wonder what window manager the writer had  in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.  Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.   However, xstdcmap doesnt seem to try very hard to avoid  conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard  colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.   So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very  problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps  if every application used standard colormaps, things would  be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use  standard colormaps.  Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation,  XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent  with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.      According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):      For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and      base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.       To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following             (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF      XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is      used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c     to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the      call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is      specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the      total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%      of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.     Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation      to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.      When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,      defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,      and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3,      one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.      When red_mult, green_mult, and blue_mult all equal 1,      XmuCreateColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CrCmap.c, constructs      a gray map. The sum of red_max, green_max, and blue_max gives      the maximum gray value.  Referring to section 14.3, on would      expect red_max to give the maximum gray value. ",2,comp.windows.x

I used to think this way, and not just about X. For example, incorrect English constructs such as ""its raining"" or ""its window id"" annoy me. However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way things really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS was really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think its(!) technically superior as well!).  On a related topic, who is to say that ""color"" is more or less correct than ""colour"" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed to American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API terms such as ""XAllocColor"" and ""colormap"".  In a world that uses the term ""Windows"" to refer to Microsoft Windows, perhaps the time has come to accept ""X Windows"" as a valid term for X. I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say, ""the X Window System"" and, lets face it, almost everyone uses it. Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate people. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short, snappy, descriptive title (""X"" is positively obscure) will help when dealing with the average punter (its sad - I thought I was a software engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become popularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should be called ""Microsoft Windows"" or ""the Microsoft Window System"" or how about just plain ""Microsoft""!  To summarise (or should that be ""summarize"") the point of thisI think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system (or should that be ""windowing system""). Whatever gets recognised is fine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what trade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System.   			Gerard ODriscoll (gerard.odriscoll@dps.co.uk) 			Du Pont Pixel Systems Ltd.

" (2nd posting of the question that just doesnt seem to get answered)  Suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped Window that contains Xlib graphics.  A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item to be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea()  (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles ""regular"" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care of rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a ""proper"" way to do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is guaranteed to be mapped.  The problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window is already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow ""tickle"" the Window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable it to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.  What is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior? ",2,comp.windows.x

Mitchell                           March 23, 1993  In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.   Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.   This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of - tele-operations and virtual reality research  - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation  - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers  - art and theater  - bbs and online network users  - software and game developers  - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains  - children  - the child in all of us   LTM1 OVERALL  A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The ""floor"" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.    The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;  2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and  3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.    Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on  it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture  content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent  to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.   The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.   Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.   Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.   By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.   PLAN OF  The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide ""rail stock"" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial ""ground breaking"" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbss. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.   A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.   A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the ""action"" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue ""challenges"" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.   The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!  EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting peoples minds in space.

I havent seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau)  was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from 2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing with the Energia-M last year and I havent heard which won, except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the  successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in  Russia. Im sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue  their development.   The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton  is 4 so thats a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I dont know about launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRBs probably shake things up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now. Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know  how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad?    They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads  (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention.

In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think. I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost 90 degrees.  u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured. Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.  a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from 0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun. The spring equinox occurs at a=0.  L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day). On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees) L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.Define the auxiliary angles p and qsin p = sin a sin z cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees) L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)  Wait!  But what is h? The cutoff function h is defined as h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1       = 1    if   s > 1       = -1   if   s < 1  As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will shows how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year. Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles. Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below the arctic circle.  -- Rouben RostamianDepartment of Mathematics and StatisticsUniversity of Maryland Baltimore CountyBaltimore, MD 21228, USA",1,sci.space

" ee0i+@andrew.cmu.edu (""Ethan Z. Evans""):  : Of course, penalties will have to be:  ::::   NO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should only be three 1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your    body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.  2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the    current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you    are thrown out of the game, and fined.  3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot    is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.  Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one, until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in the act of shooting when the foul ocured.  This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most exciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better. Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can take a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network announcers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and Marv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before the PA announcer says it.  Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network can sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told them who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a  chance of pronouncing his name right.  Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week, for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the Laker Girls get to do their  routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods either. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a 10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.  The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening. On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch it on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then it truly is a sad day.  Enough for now.  dvb ",0,rec.sport.hockey

" NETWORK RESOURCES  OVERVIEW      You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of     computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In     general, however, systems connected to the net fall in one of three    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these     networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to     special servers.      The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of     several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.      One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central     distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In     addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for     Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more     specialized mailing lists described below.      A second mechanism is Usenet netnews. This is somewhat like a bulletin     board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews     separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a     group name. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are     called sci.space.news, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, sci.astro,     and talk.politics.space. Contributors post submissions (called     articles in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends     it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby     machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so     that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet     sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was     posted.      Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and     BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not     accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more     flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make     it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS      SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the     International Space University (in only its second change of management     in over a decade).

" I am trying to build and use imake (X11R4) on an IBM RS/6000 running AIX V3.2. I am having the following 2 problems.  (1) Many of my Imakefiles have contructs like                 /**/#This is a makefile         at the start of lines to pass Makefile comments thru the C         preprocessor and into the Makefile.  Most of the C preprocessors that         I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the         line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the         start of a directive.           However the IBM cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol         as the start of a directive.  The cpp fails when it determines         that ""This"" is not a known directive.  I have temporarily hacked my         imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better         fix.  (2) Several Imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular         use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  The AIX cpp         gives warnings about these situations but continues to work OK.  If you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, I would appreciate information about on your solutions.  (Perhaps, this is solved in a later version of imake that I have not reviewed.)  Also, do you know of other cpps that behave similarly?  Since I do not have easy access to News, a response to white_billy@po.gis.prc.com would be appreciated. ",2,comp.windows.x

" ""Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be Impossible""  Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the headline shown above. The article starts with ""A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible."" OConnor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research ""is a real question for me."" OConnor said ""everything is fair game,"" including ""dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.""  OConnor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says OConnor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of OConnors briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing OConnor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [""wingless Orbiter""] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard OConnor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a ""moderate"" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the ""high cost"" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as ""one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.""  The last sentence in the article contradicts the title & the first paragraph. The sentence reads ""He [OConnor] said a streamlined version of the planned space station Freedom is still possible within the administrations budget guidelines.""  ",1,sci.space

"      I am working on an X-Window based application that needs to  override some of the window manager focus processing.  I am  using X11R4 and Motif 1.1 currently, although I will also be  working with Open Look in the future.       What I need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the  user from switching from one window of the application to  another window.  Lets say, for example, that Window A is on top  of Window B in the window hierarchy.  Normally, if the user clicks  the mouse in Window B it will be brought to the top of the  window hierarchy and placed on top of Window A.  Under certain  circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in Window B I need to  beep and prevent Window B from being raised on top of Window  A.        From the research and testing Ive done so far, it appears that  this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this  case Motif.  I havent found any way to override this default  processing through standard X Window functions.  I can tell  when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping  notify events, but I cant find any way to tell Motif not to make the  switch.        The temporary solution Ive currently come up with is very  kludgy but it partially works.  When I detect such a window switch  in those cases when the switch is not allowed, I manually force  the formerly top window back on top with an XRaiseWindow call  and beep with the XBell function.  This provides the necessary  functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places  twice.        Does anyone know how I can tell Motif (or preferably *any*  window manager) when I dont want the window order switch to  actually take place?  Respond either by e-mail or posting to this  newsgroup.

The ""whole Russian strategy"" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano, who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade  away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with Philly after leaving here.  Also, its not the volume of trades that will  necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a  great player at one time.  Most of Murrays trades have worked significantly to the Wings advantage, with those that didnt being soured mainly by  injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back problems from which he never really recovered).  Put Scotty Bowman, Pat Burns, or any of the other better coaches in the  league behind the bench of this Detroit team, and they could beat anybody.  --Randy   ",0,rec.sport.hockey

"  The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but Kevin Dineens 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win, 7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led the comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at 3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd. Tommy Soderstrom stopped 41 of 45 shots on goal to improve his own record to 20-17-6 as he was tested by Mogilny and LaFontaine all night.  Roster Andre Faust was once again recalled from Hershey, Shawn Cronin was a healthy scratch. Eklund-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-BrindAmour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Faust-Acton-Brown  Galley-Bowen Yushkevich-Hawgood Carkner-McGill  Tommy Soderstrom  Game Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that woman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!  The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that he was getting bored back there...  Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead atGarry should turn down their assists :-).  The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when Terry Carkner took a boarding minor atthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not a terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.  Keith Carney took a holding penalty atgive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league didnt allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty atthe Sabres another power play, but they couldnt get anything going and the fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.  Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was Russ Farwells trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed Snider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and theyd do it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for next year he said that its Russ call, and Russ will evaluate things at the end of the season. He feels that theyre 3 years away from a shot at the Cup. He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.  Hes very happy with the re-alignment (he called it ""outstanding""). Happy with the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux of Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable. Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in four years if there was a consensus.  The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May took a tripping penalty atgetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the top of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling through the slot. Fuhr didnt know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was all over it.  The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them. Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer took a dive to get the other (there was no video) atget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the FLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but BrindAmour hustled ahead to make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS atMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.  But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to just get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it. Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right next to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and mistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didnt even swing his stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, atend for the FLYERS. Lindros put them right back on the power play atminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get set up quickly, but couldnt get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended. Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a faceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of him. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major, 7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to Ledyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of the net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had moved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving at the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net atput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.  The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the neutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post atthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off angles...  That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.  Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in the slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.  Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under Soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on, horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange reason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they could be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade that went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...  Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor atcould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through, but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass, but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing puck over the goalie for his 11th at But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew in, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstroms 5 hole for his 76th at Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty atin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in the middle. While BrindAmour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the line and wristed a perfect shot low to Haseks glove side at Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty atThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. BrindAmour and Ledyard went after it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead atfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th of the season.  Then Carney took a tripping penalty atpower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the chances on the FLYERS resulting power play.  Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to make some big saves. The Sabres werent able to pull Hasek as time was running  out as the FLYERS wouldnt allow any consistant possession for the Sabres. Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left corner and BrindAmour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found Dineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season aton his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo, and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the game.  So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadnt been tested much in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night (unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I dont think so). The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place since the Rangers lose the tie breaker.  A couple misc Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.  In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award, but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.  The Times of Trenton has reported that ""a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma"" has looked over Tommy Soderstroms medical record and determined that no further tests are necessary in the near future.  Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he expected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back, he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a role scouting if Farwell didnt want him back.

Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the    tanks big enough.  Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a telescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets for steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie during our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much continuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and flip the payload around to look at the Sun.  We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (Im speaking only from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.  This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas  quantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and Ill try to get you in touch with our ground crew people.  Cheers, Craig  -- DONT DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE! OK! ",1,sci.space

" NASA Headquarters distributed the following press release today (4/6). Ive typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the Presidents new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""  NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East- West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.  ",1,sci.space

Wishful thinking mostly. Its more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we cant get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch,  and its position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with its heat  sink capacity could offer some military utility for ""high ground"" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space  travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as  Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but thats a very minor  activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. Its likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet its too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We dont use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. Thats because we dont have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think well use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Lunas main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again. Theres little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little ultimate profit either.

ESPN had prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had contracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this one-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the season started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last night).  But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They must honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something to do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of contract with baseball.  So relax.  Im happy.

Anyone have any ideas ??    I expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network itself. To give you a real-world example, here at Quarterdeck we have roughly 100 people using DVX to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell file servers, and each other. Its not _too_ much of a load on our Ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each segment). If you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.  But the biggest problem would be the machine itself. Say you have a 486 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. If you have 10 people running programs off it, youre going to see some slowdowns because youre now on (effectively) a 3.3 MHz 486. Of course, DVX will attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, youll know it.  Having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth). It all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. youre going to see a slowdown from X-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also...) --         Quarterdeck Office Systems - Internet Support - Tom Bortels  Pricing/Ordering : info@qdeck.com  |  Tech Questions : support@qdeck.com   Q/",2,comp.windows.x

" COMET (Commercial Experiment Transport) is to launch from Wallops Island Virginia and orbit Earth for about 30 days. It is scheduled to come down in the Utah Test & Training Range, west of Salt Lake City, Utah. I saw a message in this group toward the end of March that it was to launch  on March 27. Does anyone know if it launched on that day, or if not,  when it is scheduled to launch and/or when it will come down.  I would also be interested in what kind(s) of payload(s) are onboard.

The kind of thing youre  looking for is SDI-type assignments, but itll be pretty prosaic stuff. Things like hard-kill ATBM missiles, some of the COBRA rigs -- that kind  of thing.

" These are two common subjects so I hope someone has had to deal with these specific questions.  1.  If my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method? My choices are to call XGetModifierMapping() for each key press with a  modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers in a lookup table.  I would like to do it the second way, but I cant seem to get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  I know that when an app calls XSetModifierMapping() a MappingNotify event is generated (non-maskable) which I can pick up and modify my internal table.  But, I dont seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  If I use Xt, all  OReilly has to say is ...is automatically handled by Xt....  If I use Xlib, ala XNextEvent(), I get nothing.  This all stems from problems with users of  the Sun 4/5 keyboard and the NumLock; plus various Alt/Meta/etc. modifier  requirements.  2.  I would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right of my main window.  I want it at the same y coord, and their right/left sides touching.  What I need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window  managers border for the main window.  This should ring a bell with anyone who has called XtMoveWidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the move and seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,y and seeing that it is now offset by the WM border.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held atCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earths ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

I see EVERY single >line item on a contract and I have to sign it. There is no such thing as >wrap at this university.   Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions of $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors. The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA commercialization centers; they charge a fee.  Now, Im sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack experience in several areas. Your posts show that you dont understand the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isnt a flame, jsut a statement.  Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.  >>Sounds like they are adding it to their overhead rate. Go ask your >>costing people how much fee they add to a project.  >I did they never heard of it but suggest that, like our president did, that >any percentage number like this is included in the overhead.  Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can change depending on the customer.  >No Allen you did not.

Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the only place you would find people actually interested in solving the problems and building a station.  >Kinda funny isnt it that someone who talks about a problem like this is >at a place where everything is overhead.  When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that integration isnt overhead.

The fact remains that it is the centers you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldnt address the problems until the press published the story.

You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?  >If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost >of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year.

As published in ""US Industrial Outlook 1993""  (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space  business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.     In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had  shown double digits growth rates, this years projected results are  driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are  projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7  satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also  projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year,  and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to  $450 M, future sales will be ""adversely affected by the downward  revision in Department of Defense launch plans.""                               Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries,  revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to  increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from  broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products  and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad  report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite  manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth  $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual  projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market  sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very  successful in regaining international market share in the satellite  business.     Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in  the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including  such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals)  appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually  publishes a listing of  ""Space Business Indicators"" in mid-year, and  the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released  then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if  the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the  numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.     Looking beyond this years data, future markets look quite  promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top  $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct  broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite  station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year  through the mid 1990s.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic  for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for  substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the  next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative  assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and  satellite direct broadcasting services.  I dont believe all of the  current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite  market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will  be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive  as currently projected.)     It should also be noted this years DoC data is the first  release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research  facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for  the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space  Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first  sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]   2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS    McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta  launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola  Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to  launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO  communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas  was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.     The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium  constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium  satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be  launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle  launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be  launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.   Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a  planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although  details of the launch services contract were reported to be  negotiation, and not yet final.     The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of  their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5  million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36  launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These  launches will deploy the next generation of the USAFs Global  Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other  programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is  expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected  to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.   Under this contract the USAF can also request ""launch on demand""  services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to  occur within 40 days of the request.      [provide an excellent business base for MDCs Delta launch program  through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have  a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and  sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts  for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA  Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping  MDC as a viable commerical launch company.      However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these  contracts.  Motorolas Iridium LEO communications constellation has  not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for  operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing  and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these  approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.   But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.     Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of  several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of  the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III  program in favor of the USAF NLS/""Spacelifter"" program.  At this  time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future  funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts  is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy  reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and  Congress propose cancellation of all ""ELV upgrade"" programs  (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed ""Spacelifter""  program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this years budget  deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to  find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]    3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC ""GO-AHEAD""    The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing  satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of  Commerces Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to  WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and  operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral  images of the Earth.     [by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the  operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the  request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new  venture as a ""Star Wars"" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to  provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into  digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable  customers for this service include exploration geologists,  agricultural planners, and urban planners.      It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the  1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last  November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote  sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to  this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to  all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures  would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.     There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote  sensing ventures working their way through the system at different  stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite  systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing  data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large,  government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures  such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use  innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the  margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures  appearing in the next year or so.]                    4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GDS SPACE BIZ ""STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT""     Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General  Dynamics Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker,  despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent  analysts report Morgan Stanley said ""We are more than ever  convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical  95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.""  Based upon discussions with GDs corporate  management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are  cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and  $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GDs projection of  capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.     [hurt General Dynamics Space Systems Division.  Since GD has  restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses,  many market pundits have been speculating GDs space business might  be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GDs Space  Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current  problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected  to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of  about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space  launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability  of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits  from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur  program is back on track, this division will continue to show  substantial losses.     In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation  is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.   To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional  management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.   In GD SSDs case, to get the division back on track, the management  team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with  the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would  indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch  operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince  customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would  have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in  marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for  this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly  McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash  flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction  (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed),  or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the  $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of  change for any company.]    5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND    Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is  projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990s.  In early  February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which  detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the  next decade.     Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant  position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54  international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane  holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics Atlas vehicle holds 14  contracts, McDonnell Douglas Delta holds 7, and Great Walls Long  March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.     Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can  compete are projected to come from communications satellites with  the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and  scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand  growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.     Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of  individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will  continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with  larger communications payloads carrying more transponders.  Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications  satellites should increase by 20 % over todays average level, to  about 3000 kg in GEO.     Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain  strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the  decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace  bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder  demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques  appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing  or near-term transponders.     One of the significant possible changes in the market was  identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian  launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term,  investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade  off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and  other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities  and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.     [I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.   Comparing the two surveys, there arent outstanding differences in  the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new  data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical  transponders on orbit.    I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While  fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the  established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing  demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space  transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability  service, but only from established point A to established point B.  To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable  between the points, and while there are improved network solutions,  installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost  millions or billions of dollars.      For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground  network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective  solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is  cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of  thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite  network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and  has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is  growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced,  it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to  handle the increase in traffic.     Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still  growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But  satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current  generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of  on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from  last generations satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch  demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite  launches over longer intervals.     And as last note; Arianespace didnt flag it this year, but it  looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual  commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites  per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up  to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of  about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8,  Japans H-Vehicle 2-4, Russias Proton capable of 8, and other  systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per  year.  Thats a lot of capability for a small market.     We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial  launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT     The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has  spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety  rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt  the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation  of range safety rules.      In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of  two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure  typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at  Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute  before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was  overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the  communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the  valid abort call.     Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort  command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an  investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to  launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.     Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This  investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an  incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their  investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at  lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used  in the launch.    [investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested  by the Department of Commerces Office of Commercial Space  Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.      At the time of writing this column, some of the initial  investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are  starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four  different communications channels were in use during the test. After  the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test  director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops  Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.   According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch.  Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the  NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying  the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing  explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the  best set being that clear lines of communications and clear  definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and  understanding of the mission rules were not established before the  launch.      As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these  procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.    This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has  been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they  do with commercial aircraft problems).      I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with  procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance  of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how  specific lines of authority should be delineated.]   7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED    Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new  small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.   Two versions of the launcher are beingwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the ""Severkosmos"",  launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is  projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to  an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430  kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used  with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called  Sineva.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military  establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of  spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the  Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia  facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.     [venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking  for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house  knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous  commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.     This ones a little different in that they are offering variants  of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I cant identify any key customers being  targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING    In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the  results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial  rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland  Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary  study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch  site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected  low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic  considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal  for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.     [Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still  proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland  found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if  substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected  returns were too low to justify the cost of development.      This might point out some key discriminators in judging the  feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage  sufficient to recover setup costs?   - Is there a market advantage of using the site?   - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?   - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the  investment?      Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at  Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore  Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against  these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying  on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAINS CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING    In one of his last official acts, former President Bush  authorized space technology transfer for several joint space  ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed  use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that  regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch  vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first  launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as  a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into  LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system,  including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.   Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in  development funding, and will use technology from Argentinas Condor  launch vehicle as well as from the US.     [in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small  payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either  Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.   However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout  program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the  Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on  system).      This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch  system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of  such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies  have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the  Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to  find any other European development work with even a rumor of  funding for hardware.     Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the  Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting  rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space  launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled  the country in the 1970s and early 1980s.     What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally  transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new  civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de  Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described  as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket  program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German  firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq  in the mid-1980s.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and  tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package  lagged that of the propulsion system.     It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first  scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B  satellite will study the Earths upper atmosphere and includes  cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has  yet been selected, but OSCs Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air  launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this  contract.]   10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP    PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in  late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract  from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstros PA-2  launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar  Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish  Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and  offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According  to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya  launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like  the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as ""the main  alternative rocket supplier"" for the small satellite launch service  to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the  Swedish satellite was not specified.     [funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a  small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From  PacAstros literature, the engines designed for the PA-series  rockets are built of ""off the shelf"" components based upon the Lunar  MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a  225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.      PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its  first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and  2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired  TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary  engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder  closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same  building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering,  launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support.  Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the  board of directors.      PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least  $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been  searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to  design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.     The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help  bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need  much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real  hardware.]   11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED     In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications  venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.   As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC),  headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist  Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China  Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional  communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite  system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the  satellites communications channels.      [release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid  January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of  Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg  scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional  satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has  been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530  M) through 2006.      I havent been able to establish any relationship between this  venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.   While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the  current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two  separate sastellite ventures.     The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is ""Asiasat- 2"", but I dont thinks this has any relationship with the existing  Hong Kong-based ""Asiasat"" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and  other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational  model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing  venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to  Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later  satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between  Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture  through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to  proceed.     In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with  substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This  is just another indicator to add to the list.]   12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES    South Koreas Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently  announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and  another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for  advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been  specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with  manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by  1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Koreas  aerospace technology to the level of the worlds top 10 countries by  2000.                                     [national aerospace industry, specifically including space  activities. Im noting this as a flag that potential new players are  coming into the commercial space market.     As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications  satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995  on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide  television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula,  southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.     South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on  Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US  $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of  this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely ""made in Korea.""   Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite.     This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth  observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System)  project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean  government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with  optical and microwave sensors.    South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel  military effort to establish the capabilities for building and  launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a  government panel had been established to oversee such an effort,  funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an   expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the  Korean peninsula.           In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean  is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing  aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is  offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as  part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of  consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports  satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has  announced teaming for production of OSCs Orbcomm user terminals.).      This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.   Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector  for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a  South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition  of commercial space market there over the next decade.]   13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH    As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the  results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and  investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of  March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the  market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+%  of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a  general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The  increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which  is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this  trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite  well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms  which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its  results in all of 1993.  Well keep an eye on these ....

"  Ive been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. Ive  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Note forsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is  currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale  experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.  On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled  ""Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions"" here at the University of Illinois. Mr Nelsons job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with  them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used  the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I dont think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope they arent - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.  The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in  mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs                  ______ 3 G         /|   /      |            / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly            /  | /        |	   good.  The big difference is that the lines 2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are         /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as        /                |          the graph wasnt up for very long. 1 G   /                 |                         |                         | 0 G                     |               ^          ^            ~100 sec    ~400 sec   As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below 3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are  throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in  accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely.  The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to  that desired.  Questions from the    all at once?    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.    Mynational security or MD protecting their own interests?  The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and  the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar, and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start its reentry profile about  60 degrees south latitude.  I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didnt know about that aspect of the flight profile.  --  Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu 		    ""Find a way or make one."" 	             -attributed to Hannibal ",1,sci.space

I dont know what a ""low grade"" fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.  This thread reminds me of Wingos claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasnt content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earths crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.  On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; ""high-Ti"" basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).

" Apparently, Part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when I posted it; to make things worse, I lost my own copy.  I have asked on the Sharks mailing list, on which it did get out, to see if someone can mail me a copy back.  If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will re-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.  #8	LARRY DEPALMA No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at the end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he wasnt in San Jose, he wasnt in Kansas City, and his name hasnt appeared on the waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good defense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.  #10	JOHAN GARPENLOV		pick in 92 entry draft from Vancouver After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power- play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite his small size (5 11"", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will be a major key to the offense next year.  #15	DAVID BRUCE After a banner 91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the Sharks first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame, because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.  #18	MARK PEDERSON It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers decision to unload Pederson, after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with 41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size (and the willingness to throw it around, although hes not considered a physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much, exactly, Pederson can do.  #20	JOHN CARTER Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about 20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end, but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He is very unlikely to be back next season.  #28	JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN I dont understand why the Sharks didnt let Quintin play any more than the 14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training camp before the 91-92 season limited Quintin, the teams leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.  #41	MARK BEAUFAIT After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5 9"", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times, although its too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and Kansas City.  #42	JAROSLAV OTEVREL Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either, although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those 7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his defense is acceptable, he should be ready.  #44	MICHEL PICARD The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City. He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks bait in the expansion draft.  #45	DODY WOOD I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although 13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games, projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  Hes not ready, and needs at least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if nothing else.  His relatively small size (5 11"", 181 lbs.) does not give much possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.  =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!

You can generally tell the difference just by using it.  If the cursor blinks a lot when theres screen activity, its probably a software cursor.  If it has a hardware cursor, I think youre probably battling a bug in HPs X server.  Im not familiar with any hardware cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  Its quite possible that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually checking it.  I vaguely recall that very old MIT server revisions did just  that.  In reality youre probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless of what the server returns.  -joel ",2,comp.windows.x

"                         LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics                 Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists            CLAIM to be looking for a ""Unified Field Theory"" in which all            of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single            set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically            IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!                  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larsons comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he            calls the ""Reciprocal System"", is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and                    (1) ""The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE            component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE            UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.""                      (2) ""The physical universe conforms to the relations of            ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are            ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.""                      From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE            Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of            translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-           rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward            SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light            (which Larson called ""UNIT VELOCITY"" and ""THE NATURAL            DATUM"").                        At each step in the development, Larson was able to            MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the            REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles            [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star            clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white            dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET            DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY            BURSTS).                            And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom,            Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-           atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of            matter.                  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy            complex mathematics, in his books.                   BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson                           The following is a complete list of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larsons books about his comprehensive GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.  Some of the early            books are out of print now, but still available through            inter-library loan.

Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and            should be available via inter-library loan if your local            university or public library doesnt have each of them.                  Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available          1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the            organization that was started to promote Larsons Theory.             They have other related publications, including the quarterly            journal ""RECIPROCITY"".                         Physicist Dewey B. Larsons Background                     Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer            (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he            died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in            Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He            developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE            chemical properties based only on the elements used.                      Larsons lack of a fancy ""PH.D."" degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is            NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same            time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX            physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer,            well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC            ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..                       Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally            test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.             He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER            researchers experimental and observational data.  And in            many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.                      A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX            physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking            for a ""unified field theory"" that works, but have been            IGNORING one for over 30 years now!                      ""Modern physics"" does NOT explain the physical universe            so well.  Some parts of some of Larsons books are FULL of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree.  And remember that ""epicycles"", ""crystal spheres"",            ""geocentricity"", ""flat earth theory"", etc., ALSO once SEEMED            to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.                           Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior,            was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larsons Theory, and was (or            still is) President of Larsons organization, ""THE            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE"", and Editor of            their quarterly Journal ""RECIPROCITY"".  He moved to            Minneapolis after retiring.                   ""Super Collider"" BOONDOGGLE!                           I am AGAINST contruction of the ""Superconducting Super            Collider"", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS            WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of ""scientific""            value.                      Most physicists dont realize it, but, according to the            comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist            Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY            particles (""mesons"", ""hyperons"", ALLEGED ""quarks"", etc.)            which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab,            Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are            CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment.                      A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a            few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not            seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE            CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!                      Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3            BILLION cost?!!  Dont we have much more important uses for            this WASTED money?!                            Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of ""fire ants"" eating the insulation off underground            cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the ""Supercollider""?!                                 Naming the ""Super Collider"" after Ronald Reagon, as            proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be            named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.                     LARSONIAN Anti-Matter                           In Larsons comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made, in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light,            which Larson calls ""Unit Velocity"" and the ""Natural Datum"".                       In Larsons Theory, a positron is actually a particle of            MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet,            the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their            respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each            other.                        In Larsons Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical            universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension            of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our            MATERIAL half.                      LARSONIAN Relativity                           The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the            rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter,            etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to            help ""prove"" Einsteins ""General Theory of Relativity"".                      But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results            CLOSER to the 43 seconds than ""General Relativity"" can, by            INSTEAD using ""SPECIAL Relativity"".  In one or more of his            books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH            ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.                      Larson TOTALLY REJECTED ""General Relativity"" as another            MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of ""Special            Relativity"", including the parts about ""mass increases"" near            the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on            doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than            1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT,            although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).                       In Larsons comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the            physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead            of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured            from our material half of the physical universe.  The one            dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low            relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are            NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and            the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR.            [Larson often used the term ""COORDINATE TIME"" when writing            about this.]                            In regard to ""mass increases"", it has been PROVEN in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is            ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists            are IGNORING the THIRD          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is            actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS            BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.             The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward            SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of            the so-called ""Big Bang"" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL            FANTASY).                                                                 THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION                 I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book ""THE UNIVERSE            OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific            Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456            pages, indexed, hardcover.                      It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL            UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that            author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.                      It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical            mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and            multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of            the ""3-degree"" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-           ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white            dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..                      It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL            looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with            OPEN MINDS!                      The following is an example of his Theorys          In his first book in 1959, ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL            UNIVERSE"", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING            GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding            them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larsons            comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he            had an immediate related explanation for them also.                    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS                 Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were            originally thought to originate from ""neutron stars"" in the            disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in            Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT            correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of            directional coincidence).                      Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of            his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", published in 1984, the            gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the            ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls            the ""Cosmic Sector"".  Because of the relationship between the            anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and            the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at            random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects, and come from all            directions uniformly.)                      I wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most            life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to            stop it!                      Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were            actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!                   LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation                           About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.                      But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY            CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of            the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey            B. Larson.                      I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is            detailed in Chapter 7 of his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION""            and in some of his other books.                      First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate            energy by ""fusion"".  A small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE            ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each            element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the            element is, the lower is this limit.  A stars internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements.                      When the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I            SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron            present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some            of his books [better than I can].                      When the star explodes, the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The            explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and            it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN            SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.                      Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall            back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The            material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a            WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward            the ""MAIN SEQUENCE"" from opposite directions on the H-R            Diagram.                      The chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space, making a single lone star            again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY            system, orbiting each other.                       According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE            DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown            outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about ""degenerate matter"", ""neutron            stars"", ""black holes"", etc..                   LARSONIAN Solar System Formation                 If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single            white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL ""mini"" white dwarf            stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably            still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected            by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!                        In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all            this information, and other principles of his comprehensive            GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive            his own version of Bodes Law.                         ""Black Hole"" FANTASY!                 I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO ""black            holes"" merging together into a SINGLE ""black hole"", and            concluded that the new ""black hole"" would have MORE MASS than            the sum of the two original ""black holes"".                      Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED            FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of ""black            holes"", etc.!                      After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larsons books about            his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe, especially his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", it is            clear to me that ""black holes"" are NOTHING more than            MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is            just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the ""black            hole"" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to ""prove"" their theory.                           By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawkings severe physical            problem somehow makes him ""wiser"".  It does NOT!                      I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist            Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread            publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larsons            Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of            Unified Science).                                             ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION                 I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection            with UFOs and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to            find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.                      I found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages 112-113 of the book ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"", by            the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of            Larsons comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe.  I quote one                    ""As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.             The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It            was brought out in Volume I [Larsons book ""NOTHING BUT            MOTION""] that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that,            although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in            many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the            universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space, because they are inherently rotating units of space,            and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open            space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron,            like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system.  All            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.             Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later,            whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.""                            Note that in Larsons Theory, UNcharged electrons are            also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) spinning            around one axis at a particular rate (below the ""unit"" rate).             (""Unit velocity"" is the speed of light, and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light,            according to Larsons Theory.)  [I might have the ""above"" and            ""below"" labels mixed up.]                      Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-           LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light!                      If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a            charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion. (In Larsons Theory, an electrical charge            is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) superimposed on the            rotation of the particle.)                        The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds.               SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics                 The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical            universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has            been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in            his first book ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"".                      It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan,            and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call            ""science"" (or ""physics"", or ""astronomy"", etc.), as well as            the ""scientific"" literature and the ""education"" systems, to            TOTALLY IGNORE Larsons Theory has they have.                      Larsons Theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such            as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.                      Larsons Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY            discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals,            in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles            of Larsons Theory should be included in all related courses            at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and            elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.

" By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff  AtTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of 17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to the playoff-bound Blues.  The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3. With the North Stars loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit playing.  They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer. Tampas Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating supervisor John DAmico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the shot had gone into the net after time had expired.  ``Im glad I didnt see it go in at the end,"" Blues coach Bob Berry said.  If the goal had counted, hed have been more upset than he was by the Blues disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making the playoffs tempered Berrys anger.  ``It wasnt pretty at the end,"" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldnt have, but it did.""  Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at games end. Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this season, the Blues still made the playoffs. Theyll meet the Chicago Blackhawks in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at Chicago Stadium.  The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points, their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay, which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.  The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.  ``Its a shame we let down,"" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others. ``There was no need for a letdown. If wed have kept working, it would have ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.""  Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs. ``We won, and thats all that matters,"" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3 for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.""  Some players didnt have a problem.  ``Just because the score was announced, our line didnt quit,"" said Rich Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You cant allow five goals like we did, thats not right.  ``It was disappointing to see what was going on.""  Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues effort. Somehow, he missed the announcement of Minnesotas loss.  ``I didnt know it was final,"" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the bench. I didnt realize it was a final for some reason. Were in the playoffs, and thats great, but its a little disappointing to play like we did at the end.""  The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.  ``I told them I didnt want to see the score, I didnt want to know the score,"" Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and thats the approach we took.""  If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.  Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd going atMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.  With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.  Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.  Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the  rebound of Bret Hedicans shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of the season and reminded him of a special friend.  Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.  ``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,"" Bassen said. ``Hes in heaven now, and I know he was watching. I know hes happy.""  Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo atlater, making it 5-1.  Less than a minute after the North Stars final was announced, Tim Bergland scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.  Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span ofperiod.  The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahans second goal stand up as the winner. ``We were in there,"" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.""    %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*   *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    %    %   \ \_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    *    *    \    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    %    %     \    ________/                                                   *   *      \   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        %    %       \  \                         Contact for the Blues             *   *        \  \  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               %    %        (___)             BLUES                                       *    *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%  ",0,rec.sport.hockey
" Acronym List for sci.astro, sci.space, andEdition 8, 1992 Dec 7 Last This list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing acronyms in the space-related newsgroups.  If I forgot or botched your favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if theres an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure it out, Ill add it to the list.  Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated every acronym I ever saw, Id soon run out of disk space!  :-)  The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All comments regarding it are welcome; Im reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.  Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- youre on your own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as theyre introduced are omitted. Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless theyre simply different ways of referring to the same thing.  Thanks to everybody whos sent suggestions since the first version of the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu), who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de), who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).  Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA Reference Publication 1059Associatedmammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.  Special Bonus!

Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for Kansas City, youll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the 4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.  >He then was sent down to >Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated >when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from >the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks >officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.  Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isnt quite accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing, which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which point he disclosed the injury. Since he didnt disclose it, the Sharks and he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not reporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a no-no).  Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was hurt. I expect hell surface with another team at some point (probably another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players motivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a bad judgement call.   >#20	JOHN CARTER>> > He >is very unlikely to be back next season.  Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but hustle isnt always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Ottos neck and another wrapped around Ottos stick arm. Otto casually turned around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter wasnt there. Hustle can only cover size so far.  The Sharks have told me, point blank, that hes gone for good (ditto HUbie McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me ""you have to make room for the kids"". Carter, in fact, refused to report to K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto retirement, but I havent heard anything official. His only hope in hockey now is the Gulls.  >#28	JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN>> >I dont understand why the Sharks didnt let Quintin play any more than the >14 games he played this season.  Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked fairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didnt think he was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.  > He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.  Agreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you wish theyd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you can really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have trouble, since you dont see the off-puck action. your views from home and my views from the ice differ in numerous ways)  >#41	MARK BEAUFAIT>> >After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the  Coffee.

However, as few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate to judge the talent too quickly. Butn in Dodys case, I""m tempted to make an exception.

Vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! He couldnt hit a bull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick  scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later hes gotten worse. Hes a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!  As for Pilon, he cant carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck  towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He cant stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or  committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!  As far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps. Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first round. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they should play well against Jersey tonite. Itll probably be another tight 1-goal game as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a lead they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive shell and letting the opposition get back in the game.

In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals, 12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him up front as well.  Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period of the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win, and played again for Hershey Sunday night. Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi Beranek-BrindAmour-Dineen Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy Acton-Brown  Galley-McGill Yushkevich-Cronin Carkner-Hawgood Bowen  Tommy Soderstrom in goal.  Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.  Game If the FLYERS played like this every night, theyd be in the playoffs this year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.  Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal. He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead of taking the shot he found BrindAmour crashing the net on the other side. A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppas body should have been a goal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.  Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked Doug Gilmour atunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept away every rebound.  After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod BrindAmour gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef Beranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners. Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into him, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno was a little far from the boards, and Mike ""Mister"" McGeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at The Leafs couldnt get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were very aggressive (for a change) on the kill.  With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leafs blue line. They were in a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk tripped up Rod BrindAmour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric gloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was running out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where Recchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle, and Eric one-timed past Puppa atBobby Clarkes 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at 117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.  Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy atthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with a slash atof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers flared a little atgot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a hooking minor atstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell. Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich. Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point, and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net, but Soderstrom stoned him.  The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didnt get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.  The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a little.  The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the period, but couldnt get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros  (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing) all at Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.  At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on its side, and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other). Seconds later Rod BrindAmour tripped up Gilmour atLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom stoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through Soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout.  Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl atBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. Atexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS zone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran his stick across McGills face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all. 5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches. Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got a couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest in stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and BrindAmour played catch until Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and blasted it past Puppa at That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa did, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the 3rd. Probably the strongest game Ive seen from the FLYERS since the All Star break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in the NHL, but hes played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I cant remember that hes tied with.  Next up its the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night in Washington would be the official end.  FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better than 5 under in 80).  Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th is 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the goal for the team to focus on.

" [again, poseted for a friend]  Okay, I got such great response from my last question (thanks, everyone),  lets try How can I tell if a colorcell is read-only?  I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to a requested color.  Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will  then be flagged as used by my application so that it doesnt later get freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another application.  So far, the only way Ive figured out to do this is to write my own error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable. But life would be much easier if I could just detect the read-only/shareable stuff directly...  Any ideas?

I know what you mean!  I glow everytime Ronnies out on the ice. In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person is that I can key in on him instead of watching what Id probably be seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.  He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took that advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldnt and wouldnt play a lick of defense.  Its really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought all of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has certainly helped, and even ol Kjell has been steady.  But looking at this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it wouldnt matter.  If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would be 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (Id love to put Francis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage the Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.)  Mom.  ",0,rec.sport.hockey

Beyond that, I have no other info.  The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercurys observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverriers system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, twere not so.  Mercurys perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the suns mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einsteins synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian  geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of its most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercurys perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcombs numbers rather than Leverriers.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and thats fine.  But subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar have been fruitless.  -Bill Gawne   ""Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe   are the laws of the universe.""                       - G.

Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. Ill typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :   			The Microlight Solar Sail 			-------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a conventional type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a differenttiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods arepanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. Fora) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entryis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.Oxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England  --------------------------------  This guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or seeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more information.

I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market. Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there are mines closing because they cant compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  ""Demand and supply balance will collapse"" is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate.  Uranium from seawater is interesting, but its a long term project, or a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency.  	Paul F. Dietz 	dietz@cs.rochester.edu ",1,sci.space

Actually, Hiten wasnt originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all, so it indeed didnt have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldnt be positively confirmed.  It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit. If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from what youd need for the brute-force approach. --  All work is one mans work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry ",1,sci.space

The problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators, and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately, the specification for XGrabKey doesnt allow AnyModifier to be combined with other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this""Ctrl Any<Key>q"".  >In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says ""For information >on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4..."", this is so you >know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.

For >example, the>	Shift<Key>>will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as >the Shift key (and the q key).  This is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using event handlers instead of grabs; its not true for menu accelerators.  If youre a Motif implementor, Id suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics changed to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the users expectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as translations.  >Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?  If you mean ""menu accelerator"", no its not possible.  Thats according to the definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.  >Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you >cant use XtInstallAccelerators().  I cant think of a reason why not.  >How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of >case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one >menu entry.  There is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu accelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators resource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shells accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with XtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).  For example,    applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade 					  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton 							  - exitPushbutton    *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O   *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O   *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q   *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q    *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\n\     Ctrl<Key>    Ctrl<Key> You have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you can implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then XtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.  I tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I used TeleUSEs TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators on the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I described above should work.  -- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com) ",2,comp.windows.x

" From the ""JPL Universe"" April 23, 1993  VLBI project meets with international space agencies  By Ed McNevin      Members of JPLs Space Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) project team recently concluded a week-long series of meetings with officials from Russia and Japan.      The meetings were part of ""Space VLBI Week"" held at JPL in early March and were intended to maintain cooperation between international space agencies participating in the development of the U.S. Space VLBI Project, a recently approved JPL flight project set for launch in 1995.      U.S. Space VLBI will utilize two Earth-orbiting spacecraft -- the Japanese VSOP (VLBI Space Observing Program) satellite with its 8-meter radio telescope, and a Russian RADIOASTRON 10-meter satellite. Both spacecraft will team up with ground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio telescope observing power by a factor of 10.      Japans VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to conduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft will exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory radio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for roughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object while within view on Earth.      According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPLs project manager for the U.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit Japan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio interferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex observations required by the Space VLBI project.      ""One of our main activities is developing the methodology for international coordination, because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while using the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same celestial objects,"" said Smith.      Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in Japan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of ground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and high-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the information to a correlator located at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will combine and process data, then make it available to mission investigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.      Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created by the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with better resolution than has ever been achieved before by ground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a closer look at distant objects in space.      ""There is a long history of radio astronomy using ground-based telescopes,"" said Smith. ""What we intend to do is to extend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other active radio sources to understand what drives those things we have seen so far with radio astronomy.""      Smith noted that if one examines ""the active galactic nuclei, youll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than light, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater than you would expect.""      He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be located in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel the jets. Smith hopes that ""by using Space VLBI to look further into the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved.""      Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and transmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and Japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this year. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and engineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA Correlator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd data patterns that will originate from the more than 20 ground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.      Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the Japanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at JPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the political uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that countrys participation in the project.      ""Nothing is ever smooth,"" he said, ""but the Russians have been incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors beyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these things going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard, and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level.""      Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a science mission.      ""The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since international cooperation is essential to their science mission,"" he said.      But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials look at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase the technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly regarded Mach V launch vehicle.      Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an ambitious project, JPLs Smith is satisfied that planning for the Space VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and political hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.      ""Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and if either falls out, we would still have something with the other. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent, scientifically exciting missions.""                            ###      ___    _____     ___     /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

" You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan. Anybody who plays the way he does, does not belong in the NHL. There have been cheap shot artists through the history of the game, but a lot of them have been talanted players. Bobby Clarke, Kenny Linsemen, Pie McKenzie, Chris Chelios etc.. but nobody has been out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as Ulf. Violence in hockey has got to be curbed and players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson dont belong. When players like Ulf, whos main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed to continue, and the league wont stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000 aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day. The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a Stanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers in the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not even notice hes gone. Hes an eyesore on the game of hockey.   Rich    ",0,rec.sport.hockey

We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit TrueColor visual.

XStoreColors doesnt work on cmaps 	   associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes, but 	   many clients dont bother to check, they just start 	   throwing XStoreColor calls at you.  Though both are clearly client error, this is the case with so many clients that its easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a default root window visual, than it ever would be for all these client writers to change their clients to do the right thing. --     -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com 		Evans & Sutherland ",2,comp.windows.x

They place the title at that position    and the window at a position below it.

Currently, my solution 	   XCreateWindow(...); 	   XSetWMProperties(..); 	   XMapWindow(...); 	   XFlush(...); 	   XMoveWindow(...);      It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering    if Im overlooking something obvious.     Richard.   I know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for the border of a window or for the ""user"" window. Maybe other window managers have similar options. Another way to figure out the difference between the ""user"" window position and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their positions. You just have to use XQueryTree and remember that the window manager decorations window is the parent of your window. Unfortunately, you can only figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped this way.  Greeting,           Tobias (bading@cs.tu-berlin.de) ",2,comp.windows.x

For the purposes of a contest, youll probably not compete ifn you cant afford the ride to get there.  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course, if a low priced system existed, there might be demand...    I wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage low cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probably be the hardest to work out.  For example, would you allow Rockwell to loan you the engines?  And so forth...  > Any plan for doing > sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting > money in a big way. >   This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In other words, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support, navigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system.  You wouldnt want to use the expensive stuff forever, but Id hate to see folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch system comes on line.  I guess Id simplify this to say that waste is a slippery concept.  If your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years, then perhaps its not wasted money.  If your goal is to explore the moon for under $500 million, then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so.

From this account, it doesnt sound like you even saw the goal, Mike. Smith came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the back of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what happened. The puck went straight off Fuhrs leg and into the net. Fuhr never had a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it.   It was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie at the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of  their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the  goaltender, or whatever.  And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only say that he certainly didnt cause the team to lose the other three games. There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late in the third period of the 7th game of the second round. Everybody on the team has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation.  								Alan ",0,rec.sport.hockey
"   Here is a summary of Don Cherrys coachs corner from April 18, 1993. It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec series.   Pre-game comments ----------------- Dons pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series for his team.  Eposode Summary --------------- This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that he bought from the concession stand.  Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow and proclaimed ""Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks of me. Beauty.""  Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all the arenas in the NHL.  From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most penalties gets to ref in the finals.  Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup and the AHL championships.  Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved. Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who went cold.  Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The partys over, Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer be a country club.... ""NY should be achamed of themselves... If they go in the tank with Adolf there, theyll be hanging from the yardarm by their thumbs.""   Rating ------ Nothing too special in this episode.

Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that ""people arent required in all parts of all space processes"", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as ""People are required in all parts of all space processes.""

Its just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior thats no worse than your own.  Lets see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isnt, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isnt.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  ""Net.ghod wannabe""?  Naturally, Fred, youve correctly interpreted my motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didnt really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a jerk that youd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.

Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isnt clear.

"      Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on NHL teams have escalated to the following    Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top 25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.     Heres theof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (lets say, the Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like ""Bure"" ""Konstantinov"" and ""Borshevshky"". Is this North America or isnt it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec, and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other teams is getting worse as well.       I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about ""Pavel Bure, the Russian Rocket"" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, Im not a Canucks fan to begin with ;-).       Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who arent even better hockey players. Its all hype. This ""European mystique"" is sickening, but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.      With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly only getting worse.      Im all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.      I just dont want them on mine.       --  Richard J.

Standard colormaps were specd with the intention that window managers would make them available. This doesnt mean that every window manager author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and implemented this at top priority.  The ESGE server we ship makes the XA_RGB_BEST_MAP available at startup.

Since standard colormaps typically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one CLUT.  I dont believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. Rather, colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the same standard colormap. An example would be two clients that need a full color range would both use XA_RGB_BEST_MAP (or whatever its called under X11R5).  If you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default colormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into that colormap. If you cant do that, then youll get flashing on a one hw CLUT framebuffer.  Now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your client, this flashing could also be avoided. Perhaps some window managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps? --      -paul	pmartz@dsd.es.com 		Evans & Sutherland ",2,comp.windows.x

Jagr did not have a better season than      Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of      hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.       Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice      time per game and some measure of its ""quality"" (i.e., is the player put out      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up      against the other teams top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.  Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/- comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone would argue that Jagrs higher +/- actually reflected better two-way play.  In my opinion, Franciss low +/- is purely a result of him being asked to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other teams top center is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, cant even get 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.  (By the way, dont get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like overtime of playoff games).  -- Roland Dreier                                        dreier@math.berkeley.edu ",0,rec.sport.hockey

Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city.  The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold 1400 for this year.

Included with   this are classes that provide the base  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,   etc.  The terms ""Xt"" and ""Intrinsics"" are used interchangeably,   however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X   window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,   Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the   Intrinsics are not especially useful.  o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The   precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It   is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the   Object class although these are more accurately called windowless   widgets or gadgets.  o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below   the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib   functions because Xt provides most such services although an   understanding of Xlib helps with problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for critical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of the above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the appropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a list traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.  The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the interrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a work procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either of these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous to add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never be called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop about the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal. However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.  Why dont the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating system.   Is that a good enough reason -- I dont think so.Volume 6 are in error.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.  How do I use a different visual than the default? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has three things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and border pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap resource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions deals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these resources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the shell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen and DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is not properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is created.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends on the visual being used.    How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application to start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier because the basic information you need is available.  The first is a little harder because youll need to initialize much of the toolkit yourself in order to determine the needed information.  /*  * Some sample code to start up an application using something other  * than the default visual.  *  * To *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm  *  * To *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow  *  * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap  * to install.  */  #include <X11/Intrinsic.h> #include <X11/StringDefs.h> #include <X11/Shell.h>  typedef struct { 	Visual	*visual; 	int	depth; } OptionsRec;  OptionsRec	Options;  XtResource resources[] = { 	{""visual"", ""Visual"", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *), 	XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL}, 	{""depth"", ""Depth"", XtRInt, sizeof (int), 	XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL}, };  XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] = { 	{""-visual"", ""*visual"", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}, 	{""-depth"", ""*depth"", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL} };    int main (argc, argv) 	int		argc; 	char		**argv; { 	XtAppContext	app;		/* the application context */ 	Widget		top;		/* toplevel widget */ 	Display		*dpy;		/* display */ 	char		**xargv;	/* saved argument vector */ 	int		xargc;		/* saved argument count */ 	Colormap	colormap;	/* created colormap */ 	XVisualInfo	vinfo;		/* template for find visual */ 	XVisualInfo	*vinfo_list;	/* returned list of visuals */ 	int		count;		/* number of matchs (only 1?) */ 	Arg		args[10]; 	Cardinal	cnt; 	char		*name = ""test""; 	char		*class = ""Test"";  	/* 	 * save the command line arguments 	 */  	xargc = argc; 	xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *)); 	bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));  	/* 	 * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can 	 * retrieve the appropriate visual resource. 	 */ 	cnt = 0; 	top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv, 			       (String *) NULL, args, cnt); 	dpy = XtDisplay (top); 	cnt = 0; 	XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources, 				   XtNumber (resources), 				   args, cnt); 	cnt = 0; 	if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top))) 	{ 		XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt; 		/* 		 * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is no way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to be specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your application probably falls into the category of always using the default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular visual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some such).  Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server allocates resources I may not always want your application to run in TrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may be very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor or just monochrome.  As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different possiblecolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iriss offer all the above  plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that shell.  A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have its own realize method to use the visual when it calls XCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be obtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A reasonable value is probably XtNvisual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This is interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen() and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e. it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.  If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies colormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the visual.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8.  Ive done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This was especially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.  Why doesnt my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.  It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The Intrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed. It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any pending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned up before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then performed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have completed, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the list is traversed and each widgets memory is actually free()d, among other things.  As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the Intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the widgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs immediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting an application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget may not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open sockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):   	Widget 	ToplevelGet (gw) 		Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ 	{ 		Widget		top;  		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) 			/* empty */; 		return (top); 	}  	void 	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data) 		Widget		gw;		/* widget */ 		XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ 		XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ 	{ 		Widget		toplevel;  		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); 		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ 		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); 		exit (0); 	}  One can see that the above code exits immediately after destroying the toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never occur.    This works for most widgets and most applications but will not work for those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant of the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the widget may change and someday require that some external state is cleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.  One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and then test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and difficult to maintain practices.  Try the following code instead.  	#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>  	extern Widget ToplevelGet ( 	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes 		Widget		gw 	#endif 	);  	extern Boolean ExitWorkProc ( 	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes 		XtPointer	closure 	#endif 	);  	extern void ExitCallback ( 	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes 		Widget		gw, 		XtPointer	closure, 		XtPointer	call_data 	#endif 	);  	Widget 	ToplevelGet (gw) 	Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */ 	{ 		Widget		top;  		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top)) 			/* empty */; 		return (top); 	}   	void 	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data) 	Widget		gw;		/* widget */ 	XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */ 	XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */ 	{ 		Widget		toplevel;  		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw); 		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */ 		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel); 		XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw), 				  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL); 	}  	Boolean 	ExitWorkProc (closure) 		XtPointer	closure; 	{ 		exit (0); 		/*NOTREACHED*/ 	}   ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the application is next idle -- which happens after all the events are processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 11. How do I resize a Shell widget? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  After it is realized, one doesnt resize a Shell widget.  The proper thing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget using XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the Shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the request.  However, the Shell must have the resource XtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the window manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.  To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not the child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 12. Why cant XtAppAddInput() handle files? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does not fit most peoples intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not block, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to block.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF -- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to be read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based OSs it is the poll() system call.  How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use another process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe to connect the application with this other process and pass the file descriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on BSD systems is ""tail -f filename"".  Its rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_ reliable.  In 	- IBM AIX	  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other 	  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race 	  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.  	- Pyramid, doesnt work at all.  	- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as 	  sockets), wasnt completely broken, but although the writing 	  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it 	  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at 	  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks 	  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having 	  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had 	  been given the whole block).   Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as read(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and may not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with part of the toolkit.  Why they didnt also deal with signals at this point I dont know.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full details of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already familiar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may not find it useful.  Ive always found it accurate and complete, which means its a 1000 pages.  Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., ""X Window System Toolkit, The 	Complete Programmers Guide and Specification"", Digital Press, 	1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by 	Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC 	Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.  The other book I commonly recomend to novices Young, Doug. ""The X Window	Xt (Motif Version),"" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8). 	(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)  And of course OReilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt. OReilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt reference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively overhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  Im finding it very useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related information.  I read two periodicals, ""The X Resource"" and the ""The X Journal"". These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  ""The X Resource"" is published quarterly, by OReilly, with one of the issues being the MIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no advertising.  Ive found it informative with pretty good depth.  For orders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial matters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at math.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in ~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.   ""The X Journal"" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising. The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical audience.  I read it more to see whats going on then with an expectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a fairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call (908) 563-9033.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 14. What Widgets are available? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  There are three popular widget Athena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most 	  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is 	  available for ftp onMotif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on 	  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but 	  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think 	  it is poorly implemented. OLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets 	  implementing Suns Open Look specification.  Developed by 	  AT&T.  Ive never used it so cant comment on its quality. 	  Ive heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.  In addition the following collection of widgets are also Xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software 	  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked 	  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help, 	  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  Ive never seen 	  them so I cant comment. FWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of 	  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor, 	  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets 	  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine 	  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z. Xcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the 	  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for 	  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so 	  widely used. Xs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but 	  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise. Xw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written 	  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5. 	  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died. 	  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was 	  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided 	  much experience for the designers of Xt. Xo	- A widget set Im working on.  Its still primitive but you 	  can give it a try in The following specialized widgets are also Tbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif 	  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl. Plots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets). 	  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	__________________________________________ 	Name		Language	Vendor 	__________________________________________ 	Xview		C		Sun 	OI		C++		ParcPlace 	Interviews	C++		Stanford 	Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu 	__________________________________________   However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and implementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop in the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language other than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially) 	typdef struct 	{	 	    String	name; 	    long	value; 	} Arg;  and the	Arg	arg;  	XtSetArg (arg, ""name"", 3.2)  expands to 	Arg	arg;  	arg.name = ""name""; 	arg.value = 3.2;  you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value gets the integer ""3"" instead of the floating point value ""3.2"".  When the value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is wildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So, how to get around this?  The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now recomending it over the previous suggestions.  #define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \     if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \         XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \     } else { \         XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \         XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \     }   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 17. How do I write a resource converter? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):  The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5) Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow for destructors and caching of converted values.  There are several main types of resource     string to data type     data type to string     data type to data type  i) string to data type     Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings     that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often     used to map enumerated names to enumerated 	Name		Value 	""True""		1 	""False""		0      In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare     the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most     readily accomplished by the use of the ""quark"" mechanism of the     resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,     which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a     single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the     quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.      If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many     converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then     a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the     resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of     these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks     and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one     of the converters.  ii) data type to string     This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data     type converters since the use of quarks isnt necessary.  Instead,     the data type value is simply converted to a string value,     probably by the use of sprintf.      Data type to string converters are useful for applications that     wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that     they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This     mechanism can be used to provide a ""snapshot"" of application state     into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to     a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.      If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type     converter, it isnt much extra effort to write the data type to     string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure     that they are consistent.  iii) data type to data type     This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type     value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be     converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for     red, green and blue.   The type signature for a resource converter is as typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *, 	XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);     Display *dpy;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;     XrmValuePtr fromVal;     XrmValuePtr toVal;     XtPointer *converter_data;  When the converter is invoked, the ""fromVal"" argument points to the source X resource manager value and the ""toVal"" argument points to the destination X resource manager value.  The ""converter_data"" argument is an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified when the converter is registered.  The ""args"" and ""num_args"" arguments allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is invoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the Pixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.  Care must be taken with the ""toVal"" argument.  An XrmValue has the following type definition and specifies a size and location for a converted typedef struct {     unsigned int    size;     caddr_t         addr; } XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;  When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of the given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL. In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the destination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If the destination area is not large enough, then the converter should set the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the converter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply copy the converted value into the space given and return True.  If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to the address of a static variable containing the converted value and return True.  When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it becomes convenient to define a     #define DONE(var, type) \       if (toVal->addr) \ 	{ \ 	  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \ 	    { \ 	      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \ 	      return False; \ 	    } \ 	  else \ 	    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \ 	} \       else \ 	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \       toVal->size = sizeof(type); \       return True;      #define DONESTR(str) \       if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \ 	{ \ 	  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \ 	  return False; \ 	} \       else \ 	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \       toVal->size = sizeof(String); \       return True;  Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety checking on the ""num_args"" and ""args"" arguments to ensure that your converter is being called properly.  Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with the Intrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.  To register a converter with a single application context, use void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args, 	cache, destructor)     XtAppContext context;     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  To register a converter with all application contexts, use void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args, 	cache, destructor)     String from;     String to;     XtTypeConverter converter;     XtConvertArgList args;     Cardinal num_args;     XtCacheType cache;     XtDestructor destructor;  In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and XtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter and XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be used.  When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a ""cache"" argument specifies how converted resource values are to be     XtCacheNone		Dont cache any converted values     XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values     XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basis  Caching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a good idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).  The ""destructor"" argument is a routine that is invoked then the resource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is being destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer, 	XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);     XtAppContext context;     XrmValuePtr to;     XtPointer converter_data;     XrmValuePtr args;     Cardinal *num_args;  The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated with the ""to"" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed to by the ""to"" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the conversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments for the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to free the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private data passed in when the converter was registered.  Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT R5     mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c     contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 18. How do I open multiple displays? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  See ""Multi-user Application Software Using Xt"", The X Resource, Issue 3, (Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues involved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a nutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_ application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display and remove it from the application context.  The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can happen 3	1. User selects a ""quit"" button on one of the displays, 	2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message, 	3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message, 	   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.  Ill assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a problem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that display.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.  The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the Oliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult problem.  The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O error is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true for a single display X based application, but not true for a multiple display program or an application that does things other than display information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the I/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit() happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid returning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment demonstrates #include <setjmp.h> jmp_buf XIOrecover;  void XIOHandler (dpy) 	Display		*dpy; { 	destroyDisplay (dpy); 	longjmp (XIOrecover, 1); }  main () { 	... 	if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0) 		XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler); 	XtAppMainLoop (app_context); }  The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go back to the application specific data and perform any necessary cleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().  For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is first called it returns a 0 and saves enough information in the jmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to longjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this purpose it is adequate.  Some other problems you might run into are resource converters that improperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors such as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical value.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to connect to a display.  There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in November of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically said this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. What changed from R3 to R4 to R5? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This addresses only changes in the Intrinsics.  First, the general changes for each release are described.  Then a, certainly incomplete, list of new functions added and others that are now deprecated are listed.  Brevity is a primary goal.

Where are the resources loaded from? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places (from highest priority to lowest priority):  	1. Args passed at creation time. 	2. Command line arguments. 	3. Users per host defaults file 	4. Users defaults file. 	5. Users per application default file. 	6. System wide per application default file.  Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result of steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.  The per host defaults file contains customizations for all applications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either specified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.  The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program ""xrdb"" is used to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the display must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is reasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER but most do not.  A user may have many per application default files containing customizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  The system wide per application default files are typically found in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the fallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.  [Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]  You can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.  Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Suns Open Windows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located):  	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/% The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see XtResolvePathname()):  	%N	The value of the filename parameter, or the 		applications class name. 	%T	The value of the file ""type"".  In this case, the 		literal string ""app-defaults"" 	%C	customization resource (R5 only) 	%S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults. 	%L	Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja_JP.EUC"") 	%l	Language part of %L  (e.g. ""ja"") 	%t	The territory part of the displays language string 	%c	The codeset part of the displays language string  Lets take apart the example.  Suppose the applications class name is ""Myterm"". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)  	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm 	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm  As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.  Lets consider another example. This time, lets set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.  	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./% The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file Myterm.ad in the applications source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is       defined so %T and %S are useless.  With R5, theres another twist.  You may specify a customization resource value.  For example, you might run the ""myterm"" application like 	myterm -xrm ""* If one of your pathname specifications had the value ""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C"" then the expanded pathname would be ""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color"" because the %C substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource.  The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, 		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N  (batch of default settings.)  The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is   		<root>/%L/%N%		<root>/%l/%N%		<root>/%N%		<root>/%L/%		<root>/%l/%		<root>/% <root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the users home directory if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.  Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR to ""."", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ""./"", a dot followed by a slash.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 21. What order are callbacks executed in? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)  The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to modify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one currently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot guarantee the order of execution.  The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have; therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the list.  Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback  	"" 	procedure is to be appended.""   you may not infer from the word ""appended"" that the callback routines are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback list.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 22. How do I know if a widget is visible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)  > I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible > interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core > visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag > stays set to TRUE.  Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a ""deficiency"" in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the protocol.  (The ""deficiency"" is that the information is available in one way, in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section carefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.  A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from viewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped; that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency. Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol; see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.  > Is this a problem with ""mwm"" or is there something > else which needs to be done?  Youll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.  > If the problem is ""mwm"", what is the fastest > way to determine if a window is iconified?   As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action routine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget which contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the map_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are suggestions.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  You cant.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc? ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc() tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is handled something 	ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)) 	if (!ptr) 	{ 		perror (""malloc in xyzzy()""); 		exit (1) 	} To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions XtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which all use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and realloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.  In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses XtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code 	if (!ptr) 		ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type)); 	else 		ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1)); 	++count;  to be written 	ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);  Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, Ive found the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime Im allocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so I can fully recover from not enough memory errors.  XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a structure or copying a 	  struct abc *xyzzy; 	  char	     *ptr; 	  char	     *str = ""abcdef"";  	  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */ 	  ptr = XtNewString (str);  A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with malloc() and free().  I.e. code such 	 char	      *ptr;  	 ptr = XtMalloc (100); 	 /* ... */ 	 free (ptr);  may not work.  Personally, Id call any implementation that did this broken and complain to the vendor.  A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string when they should really be using XmStringFree().  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 25. How to debug an Xt application? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- First, Id recomend getting ""purify"" from Pure Software.  This is a great package for tracing memory problems on Suns.  Its a bit pricey at $2750 but Id still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb (contact support@pure.com for more info).  	Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into 	the object code produced by existing compilers.  These 	instructions check every memory read and write performed by 	the program under test and detect several types of access 	errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past 	mallocd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts 	checking logic into all of the code in a program, including 	third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies 	system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory 	usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel 	adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purifys nearly 	comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program 	down typically by a factor of two to five.  An alternative package that isnt as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on many Unixs and has pretty similar features is ""The SENTINEL Debugging Environment"".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library functions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com for more info)  Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, youll need to run in synchronous mode, easily accomplished with the ""-sync"" command line argument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then set a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the original Xlib function being called.  If you dont run in synchronous mode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to Xlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the server are asynchronous.  Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the undocumented resource ""xtIdentifyWindows"" or the class resource ""XtDebug"" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window. For     example% xload -xrm *    example% xwininfo -tree 	     <click in new xload window>  will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each window is included.  This can help for checking the location and size of errant widgets.  Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to test the way a widget manages its children, you can trybetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour of both.  Its a very clever idea.  The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from a pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and youll need to go to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands. Unfortunately you cant give them because all the input is going to your application which is stopped.  The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on your desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment) on one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly using a command sequence like 	othermachine% xhost +thismachine 	thismachine% setenv DISPLAY	thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger. 	or	othermachine% xhost +thismachine 	thismachine% gdb application 	(gdb) set environment DISPLAY	(gdb) run ...  I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method of dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to release any grabs during breakpoints.  Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and knowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing the internals of a particular widget but not very far without understanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great deal.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Why dont XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work? ----------------------------------------------------------------------    I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,    XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when    I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.    I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works    perfect, but in my ""real"" application nothing happens.   The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those routines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is they use a default application context different then the one you may have created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per application context basis and you are using two application contexts, you wont get those events.  For 	... 	cnt = 0; 	toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class, 				   Desc, XtNumber (Desc), 				   &argc, argv, 				   Fallback, args, cnt);  	XtAddTimeOut (...) 	XtAddWorkProc (...)  	XtAppMainLoop (app)  would never invoke the timeout.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop? ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)  Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an ``intuitive fashion.  Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has supported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with each other, and so far as I know, they are not published.  I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public protocol for doing drag n drop operations between clients.  My intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to support a ""standard"" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop and contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long as it is based on Xt).  The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM conventions, for more details read the code.  I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that it works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.

Hmmmm....  The prefix ""peri-"" is Greek, not Latin, so its usually used with the Greek form of the name of the body being orbited.  (Thats why its ""perihelion"" rather than ""perisol"", ""perigee"" rather than ""periterr"", and ""pericynthion"" rather than ""perilune"".)

Ville Sirens slap  shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi  scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal  put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.  The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo  made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,  during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to  Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered  the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund   skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.  Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line  where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didnt see the puck since  there was traffic in front, 4-3.  Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan ""the Shadow"" Nilsson. Stefan  and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to  Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.  Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only  21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone   with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja  made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.  The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal  late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,  showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck  and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterers goals far side.  But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the  games final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow  angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.   All in all, a decent game where the defense wasnt the best.  Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period  to try no combinations.   Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-  Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.  Stillman good on defense.  Some players arent good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner  hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson  will likely have to leave for NHL pros.   Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the  Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didnt have a very good game, weve seen him  a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finlands starting goalie in the WC.  I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-  resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Starting  	SWEDEN					FINLAND    35.

The key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the ExecuteFunction() routine in #ifdef SHAPE 	case	{	static SqueezeInfo left_squeeze = { J_LEFT, 0, 0 }; 		if (DeferExecution (context, func, Scr->SelectCursor)) 		  return TRUE;  		tmp_win->squeeze_info = &left_squeeze; 		SetFrameShape( tmp_win ); 		break; 	} 	.... and similarly for squeezeright ( J_RIGHT ) and 	squeezecenter ( J_CENTER ) ... #endif  ( Of course, you also have to define F_SQUEEZELEFT in parse.h   and add     { ""f.squeezeleft"", FKEYWORD, F_SQUEEZELEFT },      ... and so forth ... to parse.c  In order to use these functions, add something like the following to your .twmrc Button2 = m | s : w|v|d|r|i|t|door : f.squeezecenter   =================  About a year ago, I posted this, but our news was broken and I *think* it didnt get out.  Since then, ""blast"" has appeared in comp.sources.x, Volume 19, Issue 41; you could use blast to achieve a similar effect, by chiseling away at an mwm-style wide title.

Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the 30s.  For much of the 20s, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.  Its important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times inChamberlin and Levine, and Byrds _America_.

The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteigs prize, Lord Northcliffes prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a govt could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.   Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions asked.  --   Keith Mancus    <mancus@butch.jsc.nasa.gov>                           |  N5WVR           <mancus@sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov>                        |  ""Black powder and alcohol, when your states and cities fall,          |   when your backs against the wall...."" -Leslie Fish                  | ",1,sci.space

" 1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports. ------------------------------------------------- Kings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93  The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, against the second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of a non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.  Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out- standing team defense.  It took the Flamestheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play  and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10 tries.  The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the  Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex- pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to  the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this  morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.  1st1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up in his office, moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the  hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.  Millen and Fleury went off atfailed to convert.  Carson went off atDahlquist went off atsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in the period.  2ndThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into the stands and received a delay of game.  1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit  the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated  down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him  and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.  2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play. Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot  where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.  3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot, beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.  4-1.near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.  Skrudland went off atfailed to convert.  McSorley went off atpower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high sticking atKings hit 3 goal post in the period.  3rdThe Kings used the phrase ""Initiate, not retaliate"" and it was very evident here in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames  continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.  5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at thethe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him, wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.  Sydor went off at 5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the  crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.  Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where  Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing  a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at theKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at thepoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.  6-3. MacInnis took a penalty atto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone  cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed  the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass,  beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.  At thewent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames right out of the game.  On the plusas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent penalty killing.  On the minusthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.------ The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.  Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.  The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.  Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon  games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play over their last 9 games.

In the space of 9 months we were taught PASCAL, Simula, Prolog, Miranda. Also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.  They also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory, and some stuff about comms.     The PASCAL is to be replaced by C/C++ I think next year - I learnt this (and  X Windows programming as well) anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending on your tastes, the selection of skills learnt can be quite wide reaching.  The one critiscism I would level at the course, which I would have thought invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry - this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough course.  Yes, I know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!  								Mackem Ian. ",2,comp.windows.x

The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals from being scored- not to score them.  When Lemieux or Gilmour play their number one purpose is to score- defence is secondary- especially considering the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one.

I can see the relationship between free throws awarded after a certain number of fouls, but its obviously easier to score in basketball, there are more opportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, thats at least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is probably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe 5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other penalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was interfered with.  Also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA game you attended was, that play was stopped too often. Wouldnt your penalty shot rule take up more time during a hockey game?

Spaceflight is NOT in this position. The correct analogy is not with aviation of the 30s, but the long transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didnt require govt to fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit at the destination.  In practice, some were govt funded, some were private.

" As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon, dropping a 6-3 decision to the LA Kings. Most of the Flames neglected to show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at least five posts! The Flames best line was probably Skrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). Gary Suter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scored by D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also made some bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especially impressive.   The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early and never recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches, hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out Warren Rychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failed to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I dont think Vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men, as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope King inserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesdays game. Gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley-horse; no idea how serious - he didnt return.  I still think the Flames should win this series, but they better buckle down.  - Vlad the Impaler  ",0,rec.sport.hockey

Nope, youre confusing separate programs.

I do recall that the 1970 playoff picture wasnt decided until the final day, when the NY Rangers defeated the RedWings. The tie-breaker was the number of goals for (if I remember correctly), so the Rangers played with an empty net for the entire game. Some Hab loyalists accused  the Wings of throwing the game to keep them out, but as I recall,  Gordie and Delvecchio had the flu, so coach Sid Abel sat them out, and the Rangers swarmed the RedWings most of the night.

"      ...let me point out that both GUI-based word-processors and text-based    formatters both have a language; one happens to be mouse- and    action-based, and the other symbol-based.  True, but thats beside the point. This is a fact about an abstract model of what the GUI users are doing, not about what they actually *are* doing. This abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a *programmer* of the system. (aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)  Im not saying that the programmers perspective is evil or stunted. After all, thats what I do, too! I am saying that UI designers must carefully distinguish between the user/programmer conceptual models, and they must ultimately serve the user of the system, not the builder of the system.

Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and the application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution. 	In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating  independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of other callbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be  registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.  [4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leaving dangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not  actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	 	It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback, which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answer is set to one of the valid values. If it is not a ""yes"" answer, the code drops out of the callback and back to an event-processing 	void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call) 	{ 		int             answer; 		answer = AskUser(w, ""Really Quit?""); 		if (RET_YES == answer) 			{ 			answer = AskUser(w, ""Are You Really Positive?""); 			if (RET_YES == answer) 				exit(0);                 } 	}  	A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether  to overwrite it. 	This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop and waiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to the calling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the  Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of  dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for ""OK"", ""Cancel"" and  ""Help"" or   int AskUser(w, string)         Widget          w;         char           *string;   {         int             answer=RET_NONE;	/* some not-used marker */         Widget          dialog;			/* could cache&carry, but ...*/         Arg             args[3];         int             n = 0;         XtAppContext    context;          n=0;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                 XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;         XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;         dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);         XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);         XtManageChild(dialog);          context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);         while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                 XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);         }         XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */         return answer;   }  	The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same  function when tickled by the user.

Use XGetImage to grab the image from the pixmap. 5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasnt clean, and  the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you  the parts of the pixmap which arent good. 6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.

This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line  argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is  adequate. [5/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?  	The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is  as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel  window and it will be clipped to that window, so it wont affect any other  application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the  user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual  desktop.) Substitute ""toplevel"" with your top-most widget here (similar code  should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):       unsigned long valuemask;      XSetWindowAttributes attributes;       /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */      valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;      attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |          ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);      attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);       /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by         its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */      XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,          65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,          CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);  where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen, particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than 32767.  When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to normal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse events; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.  In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor  resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the cursor without blocking pointer events.

What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process,  		close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget))); to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your  exec. You will then be able to exit the parent. 	Alternatively, before execing make this call, which causes the file  descriptor to be closed on exec.

If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which  might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave the library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls any function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by  Xlib or Xt functions. 	You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which has previously been added.Volume 6 are in error.  [Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse  (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error  handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or  Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldnt be doing in any case.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	Its very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input  both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but  which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or  the other file descriptor. 	A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor, use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be  called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your  programs attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt  callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only non-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers. 	Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an  input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish. 	Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file. You will find that the function is called even when there isnt input pending. XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is  called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is new data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always  ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginning and read data youve read before.  The result is that your function will almost always be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the  type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your  function to test whether there is new	     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return; But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a  busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting  a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

If youre sending events to your own application, then you can use  XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that you avoid a round-trip to the server.

The relationship between pixels 0 and 1  and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be  reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.  Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong  thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the users preference for  foreground and background.

The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular Screen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- one which takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number. 	In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine  the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap, set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The  window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If youre  sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea()  to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read  back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and  it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD  and Stuart Marks of Sun]  	Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a  (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the pixel/pixmap however it wants.

Note  that there is no X notion of a ""transparent color index"". 	- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny  windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult. 	- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application window with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors that will appear properly.

However, the drawing operation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black and White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical coincidence will break.] 	If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be  allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen pre-computed values. 	If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you  can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics  context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over  red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red.  This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and  blue.

The red, green, and blue  fields of an XColor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is  full-blast. If you forget to scale (using, for example, 0-255 for each color)  the XAllocColor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is  usually black.   [Thanks to Paul Asente, asente@adobe.com, 7/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have an image-processing program which uses XGetRGBColormap() to get the  standard colormap, but it doesnt work.   	XGetRGBColormap() when used with the property XA_RGB_DEFAULT_MAP does  not create a standard colormap -- it just returns one if one already exists. Use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.  [1/91; from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that most servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there  -- which is usually garbage.  You probably want to clear the pixmap first using XFillRectangle() with a function of GXcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever  color you want as your background (or 0L if you are using the pixmap as a  mask). [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- My program has the ID of a window on a remote display. I want to check whether the window exists before doing anything with it.  	Because X is asynchronous, there isnt a guarantee that the window  would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent an event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send the event without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow  errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme will work except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed  and its ID reallocated to another window.  [courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually, the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that  knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except for GCs and private color cells, can be shared]. 	The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple  applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the applications running on different machines) is in the first application to  create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into it. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also knows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window. 	[application running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned in the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.] 	Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level  cooperation among your applications.  	Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to  use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it  should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.  [mostly courtesy Phil Karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do not handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return  the wrong child of root. A general solution is to add this code or to use it in your own application where you would normally use RootWindow(dpy,screen):  /* Function * * * */ #include <X11/Xatom.h> Window GetVRoot(dpy, scr) Display        *dpy; int             scr; { Window          rootReturn, parentReturn, *children; unsigned int    numChildren; Window          root = RootWindow(dpy, scr); Atom            __SWM_VROOT = None; int             i;    __SWM_VROOT = XInternAtom(dpy, ""__SWM_VROOT"", False);   XQueryTree(dpy, root, &rootReturn, &parentReturn, &children, &numChildren);   for (i = 0; i < numChildren; i++) { 	Atom            actual_type; 	int             actual_format; 	long            nitems, bytesafter; 	Window         *newRoot = NULL;  	if (XGetWindowProperty(dpy, children[i], __SWM_VROOT, 0, 1, 	    False, XA_WINDOW, &actual_type, &actual_format, &nitems,             &bytesafter, (unsigned char **) &newRoot) == Success && newRoot) { 			root = *newRoot; 			break; 		} 	}  	return root; }  [courtesy David Elliott (dce@smsc.sony.com). Similar code is in ssetroot, a version of xsetroot distributed with tvtwm. 2/91]  A header file by Andreas Stolcke of ICSI onfunctions similarly by providing macros for RootWindow and DefaultRootWindow; code can include this header file first to run properly in the presence of a virtual desktop. 	 ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managers can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but  there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. You can try setting  the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best.  [1/91]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	Its rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself [e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isnt overlapped --  imagine the conflict between two such programs running.   	The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack is to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarily assuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do  this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup  menus or other short parameter-setting windows).  [thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	There is no easy way.  Unless youre willing to depend on some sort of extension (as yet non-existent), you have to arrange for the blinking yourself, either by redrawing the contents periodically or, if possible, by playing games with the colormap and changing the color of the contents.  [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 7/91]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help  get notification of double-clicking. 	There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the  protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do  client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can defer actually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you  have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish  implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of  the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that. 	Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-click be used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the case in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, should be the single-click action or the double-click action.  [Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	 	Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics  capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphics libraries. 	Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is to render the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it ""by  hand"" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via  XPutImage(); more	1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it. 	2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage). 	3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation. 	4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where  		a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta) 		b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta) 	5) render I2 	Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose bits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better. 	The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X  also permit rendering of rotatedalthough most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the same fonts that would be found on a printer. 	In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a font on it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some predefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of each glyph.

It could be one source of example code. [Brian R. Smith (brsmith@cs.umn.edu), 3/91] 	Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts; they are  stroke-rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine  requests. [eric@pencom.com, 10/91]  	The xrotfont program by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk)  (posted to comp.sources.x July 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing  the method above and by using an outline (Hershey) font. 	The xvertext package by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) is a  set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle.  Version 3.0  was recently released to alt.sources and comp.sources.misc [3/93]; it is also  on export as contrib/xvertext.3.0.shar.Z.   	OReillys X Resource Volume 3 includes information from HP about modifications to the X fonts server which provide for rotated and scaled text.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the X protocol that define and use string names. The context is such that conflicts are possible if different components use the same name for different things. 	The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in theseorgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types, application classes, and class extension record types; and several others. 	The list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R5  tape; it is also available by sending ""send docs registry"" to the xstuff mail server.

" From another space forum >  NOW WHERE DID I LEAVE THOSE PLIERS?     When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56  solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers  lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived  the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot  altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.      NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,      ""Its been a long time since something like this happened.  Weve  lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.""      The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a  Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on  April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the workers supervisor did not act on the  report and Discovery was launched with its ""extra payload"".  NASA  officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th  launch date.      The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB  technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,  its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a  part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad. |(Rons ed.

X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X XX X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow theseX X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the followingX X---entry---X	Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author---X	use tab indented lines to continue X	dont forget to include the countryX        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named build.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is prog.c.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the aboveX X	* The title must match theX	  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X	  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X	  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X	  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X	* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X	  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X	  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X	* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X	  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set fix in the  X	  ---entry--- section to n.  The corrected entry must use the same  X	  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X	  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X	* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X	  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X	  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X	  Email message to the judges. X X	* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X	  y was given to the respective authors anon line. X X	* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X	  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X	  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X	* The entrys remarks shouldX	    - what this program does X	    - how to run the program (sample args or input) X	    - special compile or execution instructions, if any X	    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X	    - information about any ---data--- files X	    - why you think the program is obfuscated X	    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X	    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X	* Do not rot13 your entrys remarks.  You may suggest that certain X	  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X	  should not be required to exist. X X	  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X	  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X	  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X	  each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified asX X	   build is incorporated into a makefile, and build is removed X	   prog.c is renamed to your entrys title, followed by an optional X	       digit, followed by .c X	   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entrys X	       title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entrys remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the build information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entrys title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by .sh. X X       If needed, your entrys remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entrys remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.

All other uses must receive prior permission in writing  Xfrom both Landon Curt Noll and Larry Bassel. X XABOUT THISX X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW INX X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS ANDX X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be old the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to anX X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring #include lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring #define and #include lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    cleaned up by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    strangest/most creative source layout need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award worst abuse of the X    rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award worst abuse of the rules X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didnt work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES ANDX X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become old.  We X    tend to see thru masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar wont go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so doX X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- dont expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- dont use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longerX X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not beX X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading # must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading #, many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programsX X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item) X	* wont compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    best one liner category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -Ds to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -Ds in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self-replicating X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of smallest, lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Dont X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, dont depend X    on color or a given size.  Dont require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Dont use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programsX X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs cant excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesnt have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRYX X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found inX X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entrys title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the least likely to win award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of theX X	* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X	* Have the build file make copies of the files.

Send us a version of  X	  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X	  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    hints file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, dont place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools arent X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judgesX X	...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges	(not the address for X	judges@toad.com					 submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.

An example of such a stringX X	Thr Apr 01X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.

To do so, set X    the fix line in the ---entry--- section to y instead of n. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGINGX X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, eachX X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the any other text file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main prize of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number ofX X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions areX X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list mightX X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as best.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    best is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OFX X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.

" The European Space Agency has involvement with remote earth  observation, and I presume this includes surveillance (optical etc.). So its not just the US/USSR(ex) who are in the game.  But what *is* the game? What can be done with space observation? The military functions of missile spotting, troop spotting etc. are well documented, but what about anything else?  The biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a paying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.  More importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and  *underground water* from space. This would be a positive life saver for African or other drought affected countries. Implementing a clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such countries and should cut down mortalities considerably.  So how about it?

I expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and, when the new application starts up, it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap. It therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors.  This makes it look ugly until its window gets priority.  Then Macx changes the colormap so that the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted, but now other applications are having to make do with its colormap.  This is a problem with all color X servers (or at least all color Xservers I have seen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap. My solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap-greedy apps and (2) display applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather than in color (if this is an option for the application).   - Doug Shaker		1900 S.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.  3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone 70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.  5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as        a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 184 hours   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as 	Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU) 	Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU) 	Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour 	Distance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km 	Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC  1.

If I read you right, youre saying in essence that, with a larger economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,  but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a ""we have  the money, why not?"" approach.  Its conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, its possible that Luna will have a commercial purpose, but its most likely that Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred years at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can you put a 200 person base on the Moon for $30 million a year?

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday .  The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.

The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says; it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving commands.  Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer, I believe the probe starts a search for Earth sequence (involving antenna pointing and attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish communications.  No-ops are sent periodically through those periods when there are no real commands to be sent, just so the probe knows that we havent forgotten about it.

I would like to know how I can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits. I tried using the following Xlib code :  XVisualInfo visual_info; int depth = 24; Colormap colormap; XSetWindowAttributes attribs; unsigned long valuemask = 0; Window *win; Xv_opaque frame;  win = xv_get(frame,XV_XID); XMatchVisualInfo(display,screen,depth,TrueColor,&visual_info);  /* So far so good */  colormap = XCreateColormap(display,win,visual_info,AllocNone);  /* It dies here with a BadMatch error :( */  attribs.colormap = colormap; valuemask |= CWColormap; XChangeWindowAttributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs); XSetWindowColormap(display,win,colormap);   Am I using a completely wrong approach here ? Is it possible to set the depth and colormap for a window created by Xview ? What am I doing wrong ?  Thanks in advance for any help that I can get. I would prefer a response via email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.

" Alan Carter >> 3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to >> 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  > This activity is regularly reported in Rons interesting posts. Could > someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is?  The name is rather descriptive.  Its a command to the spacecraft that tells it ""If you dont hear from Earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrong with your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search mode in an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth.""  The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other. Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft, and if everything is fine, theres no reason to send it any new information.  But from the spacecrafts point of view, no information from Earth could mean either everything is fine, or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition.  Just how long should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and begins to take corrective action?  That ""how long"" is the command loss timer. During relatively inactive cruise phases, the command loss timer can be set to rather long values.  In this case, Earth is telling Galileo ""expect to hear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours"". ",1,sci.space

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2) swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.  2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.  3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data; long term trend analysis is continuing.  6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level.  7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as        a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts        b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin        c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner        d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees            off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)        e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1        f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within            acceptable range        g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range        h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,            EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS        i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within            acceptable range        j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours            Time To Initiation - 260 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21 (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.   TRAJECTORY       As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as 	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU) 	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU) 	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour 	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km 	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC  1.  As of April 15, 1993, a total of 70184 real-time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65076  were initiated in the sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process. In the past week, 7 real time commands werethe sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process.

"  Hi.  According to my always questionable newspaper, theres a silver dollar being minted in Canada, the back of which commemorates the anniversary of the Stanley Cup.  Now, I know full well what coins are used every day in Canada.  I can easily fish a few out of my pocket change right now, in fact.  My question is, since the loon is the only dollar coin that I know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative coin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  Is it the sort of thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no chance of it being circulated?  If it is an uncirculated coin, whats the current cost and whats its potential value?  Just curious.  If no one knows, Ill take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or whatever it is).

"  Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their ERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 Statute miles.  Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical  strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column.    A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile  below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.  The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support.  Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio ofheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.  This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads.  These will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor.

" Lets see. These arent, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term denotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The rockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A ""D"" engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse. An ""F"" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size ""O"" are available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as controlled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket engines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)  There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which holds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities (FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved in HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals.  Bottomthe dynamite, will ya?  -Larry C. ",1,sci.space

Look  I found this invaluble. Unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the   shared memory segments, making an XImage from it, etc. Also, there is an   extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to   test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled   in the kernel.

Yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much  less than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, and that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But the market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the last three years, and even the existing teams cant be moved for less than  $50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.

There is no easy answer to thisdevice can hold pixmaps in off-screen memory, and if so, how efficiently the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off-screen memory is the bane of the server implementors existence!).    I have worked with graphics devices where the off-screen memory to  main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy rate, and with those where the main memory to display is *faster* than off-screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather than a read of the F.B. followed by a write)  If your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into pixmaps in CPU main memory, the rates you can get through MIT-SHM are likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower, depending on your OSs implementation of shared memory) to CopyArea from pixmap to window, which is also then just a copy from CPU main memory to graphics device.  One advanage of MIT-SHM is that if your images are large, you dont end up growing the size of the server process to hold them.  One disadvantage of the MIT-SHM is that, in its sample implementation, there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments if the client dies a sudden, violent death (e.g., ""kill"").  You have to  be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.

Just as he had benefited from his predicessors funding choices, he owed it to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new missions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.   --  Covert C Beach dragon@access.digex.com ",1,sci.space

The facts are many of these people do not sustaint heir income from mining,  do not often even live their full time,  and do fotentimes do a fair bit of environmental damage.  These minign statutes were created inthe 1830s-1870s  when the west was uninhabited  and were designed to bring people into the frontier.  Times change people change.

Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not _The Gods Must Be Crazy._  In one of his lesser known books (I cant remember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola, travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when one of them drops a fob watch.  They then speculate about the reaction of the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven. But the notion is not pursued further than that.  -Scott --------------------                          New .sig under construction Scott I.

When the Pirates play, the games will be carried by  WDVE(102.5 fm).  WDVE will carry 12 games, starting with tonights game.  In fact, after this season, KDKA will no longer be the flagship station for the Pens.  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new  deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games.  It seems more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next  season.  KBL will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be  simulcast on KDKA-TV.  The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the  early round playoff games, will be available by ""subscription tv"" only. To receive the games, youll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.  Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv  simulcasts.  There will be a TV broadcast team, and a radio broadcast team.    No word on who the announcers will be.  Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald are both under contract with KDKA, but their contracts expire at the end of this season.  KBL President Bill Craig said hed like to hire Lange and Steigerwald.

But Rob Niedermayer is a center, not a defenseman.  I am not sure that the Sharks will take Kariya.  They arent saying much, but they apparently like Niedermayer and Victor Kozlov, along with Kariya.  Chris Prongers name has also been mentioned.  My guess is that theyll take Niedermayer.  They may take Pronger, except that they already have too many defensive prospects.  =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!

He viewed himself as a resourceful man, and (IMO) decided to check out gracefully if he couldnt support himself.

Now, these are just my observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had an opportunity to see all the teams the same amount. Anyway....    MVP = most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and       in terms of leadership (""cant win without him"")    Biggest surprise = the player who rose above expectation -- the player       that may have raised the level of his game to a new height, even       if that new level doesnt necessarily warrant an allstar berth       (includes those players who at the outset of the season, may not       even have been in the teams plans).     Biggest disappointment = the player from whom we expected more (e.g., I       picked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis on       offence brought by Demers, shouldnt Savard have done better?)     -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Team           Biggest       Biggest----------------------------------------------------------------------- Boston Bruins           Oates          D.Sweeney     Wesley Buffalo Sabres          Lafontaine     Mogilny       Audette (jinx?)

" In the April edition of ""One Small Step for a Space Activist"", Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger  ""Another problem is what are called wraps (or sometimes    the center tax). When work for a large program like    Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the    center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts    to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the    center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to    be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about   billion wont be spent on anything having anything    to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion    was wisely spent (and maybe it wasnt), but the work done    with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting    the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the    existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the    term center tax. They look at the Station they are    getting and the price they are paying and note that    it doesnt add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware    that a third of the money is going for something else.""  My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didnt post a response immediately, I do have a real job Im supposed to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers  Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF to 15,000 science teachers.]  First off, yes, the concept of center tax, or wrap does exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total tax for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million. This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4 center taxes. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at $2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8%  Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30 billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to $540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I will concede its still an appreciable amount of pocket change.  I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant, but you dont if you get it take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT* subject to the center tax (I dont have the numbers in front of me, but Id guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3, but its only applied to funds spent at the center, and not to the prime contracts.  This leads to the obvious question ""What is the government doing with SSF funds that dont go to the prime contractors? (i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens to the balance of the funds, which arent eaten up by the center tax?)""  At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds (as they are supporting the development work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries (to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system.  We have also used the supporting development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone. 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).  As a final example, my home division at Lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations, for performing system analyses (like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system, availability calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a  database with information on weight of the power system elements).  Finally, the money raised by the tax does not all go into a slush fund. At Lewis, the director does control a small discretionary fund. Each year, any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.  Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the general services at the Center, like the library, the  central computer services division, the Contractor  who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget doesnt go for SSF activities. To get an accurate figure, you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library (for example), and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support SSF (which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year is billable to SSF, would you base it on the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week versus the rest of the center personnel). You would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows, maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but we underpay for snow removal? Talk about a burecratic nightmare!  My last point is that I cant believe your claim that Congress has never heard of the term center tax. Unfortunately, all of the NASA testimony before Congress isnt on a computer, so I cant do a simple word search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely, in some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methods were documented for Congress? ",1,sci.space

Thats a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian & American Olympic teams have been . . . and theyve had to play according to our set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn  McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been  3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the  Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, Im sure that an All-Star team assembled from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford  or Tampa Bay currently are doing. --- But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia?  Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based (28-30=superstar) (23-27=star) (18-22=NHL regular+) (13-17=NHL regular) ( 8-12=role player) D-Jyrki Lumme.......20 D-Teppo Numminen....20 D-Peter Ahola.......13  C-Jari Kurri........25 C-Christian Ruuttu..16  R-Teemu Selanne.....27  L-Esa Tikkanen......20 (Obviously, Selannes ratings would be higher today than they were in January)D-Ulf Samuelsson....21 D-Fredrik Olausson..20 D-Niklas Lidstrom...18 D-Calle Johansson...18 D-Kjell Samuelsson..17 D-Tommy Sjodin......13 D-Tommy Albelin......7  C-Mats Sundin.......26 C-Thomas Steen......18  R-Thomas Sandstrom..22 R-Ulf Dahlen........18 R-Michael Nylander..13  L-Per-Erik Eklund...18 L-Johan Garpenlov...16 L-Mikael Andersson..15 L-Jan Erixon........14  This would be interesting. Clearly, Finlands top five players (Winnipegs Selanne & Numminen, Vancouvers Lumme, Los Angeles Jari Kurri and New Yorks Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. Theres presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldnt be superstars at the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL. --- Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America. Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawas 22 top players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in  Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points. Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the ""dynasty"" talk isnt completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time, wont have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top  Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a  couple of years the same way Edmontons ""dynasty"" crumbled in the late 80s.  Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an  exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. Id settle for a  compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during  the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this,  the amateur draft should be open to anyone.   > ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- >  J O O   J O O   J O K E R I T  !  !  !

This includes things like software inspection, a    rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,    and typically a `software engineering process group within the    project.  4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered    and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this    information. Software quality is measured and has goals.  5.

" Not being an Xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination, this is driving me crazy and its probably really simple to do.

""multi-screen"" and ""multi-display"" would, if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning of ""multi-display"" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and pointers, when its used it probably refers to the same thing ""multi-screen"" ""zaphod"" is a term applied to the way the MIT server switches the pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the screen.  > Is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle > (in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ?  There is a protocol limitation that restricts a given Display to at most 255 Screens.  I know of no server that handles multiple Displays on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the R4 server can be looked upon as such; on a TCP-based system there is necessarily a limit of 65535 Displays per machine, but this is not a limitation inherent to X.  What you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular implementation (probably the MIT one).  If it claimed there was a limit of 12 inherent to X, the author of the article had no business writing about X.  					der Mouse  				mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu ",2,comp.windows.x

Thanks for this clue, and thanks to Derek Ho also for a pointer in the same direction.  One solution, due to Derekits location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the previous popup. The slow response can be avoided by calling GetValue first, and only using SetValue if the required location is different. The problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the location of the popup, so that the SetValue really does change the location of the popup. (We tried this just for a double check on the source of the problem.)  The solutions we have tried successfully are now as 1) Use ""twm"" or ""mwm"" rather than ""olwm"" 2) Use ""olwm"", with resource ""*3) Only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.

Anyone out there know?  Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  When graphed, these define the flight envelope of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesnt fall out of the sky.  Hence, pushing the envelope becomes operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope.   Note that the envelope isnt precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is push the envelope to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, pushing back the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be pushed and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the early first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

" In article <1r28mg$9r5@fitz.TC.Cornell.EDU> matthew@alchemy.TN.Cornell.EDU (Matthew Kleinmann) |  I have a Sun 3/60 that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 ?) built on the |  motherboard.  The same system also has a cgfour (cgfour0 and bwtwo1 ?) |  daughterboard.  I have been using this system with a color monitor having a |  color ""front"" screen from the cgfour, and a mono ""back"" screen from the |  bwtwo1, both on the same tube.  I recentley picked up a 1600 x 1280 Sun mono |  monitor, and I would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and |  the bwtwo0.  I do not care if I loose the ""back"" screen on the color tube |  from the bwtwo1.  After looking through the Xsun man page I am not sure if |  this is possible.  Has anybody sucessfuly done this before?  If its any consolation, I have two 2-headed Sun-3/60 systems, though the color and mono monitors for each are ""rated"" 1152x900.   Their configuration is the same as yours, so it ""should"" be a PlugNPlay situation, I dont know if your hi-res mono monitor will function this way.  However, you may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the HI-RES jumper (located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the RAM/SIMM selects and Ethernet connection) and be happily on your way.  When you pull the motherboard, the jumpers are in the left-rear (e.g. ""north-west"") quadrant of the motherboard (to the left of the SIMM sockets).

This release of NCSA Mosaic is known to compile on the following   SGI (IRIX 4.0.2)    IBM (AIX 3.2)   Sun 4 (SunOS 4.1.3 with stock X11R4 and Motif 1.1, and GCC).   DEC Ultrix.   DEC Alpha AXP (OSF/1).  Documentation is available online.  Changes since 0.13  o Added new resource, gethostbynameIsEvil, for Suns that    coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what    their own names are. (Command-line flag is -ghbnie.)   o Explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view    window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so    themselves.   o Better visited anchor color for non-SGIs.   o Added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files.   o Added Clear button to Open box, to allow more convenient    cut-n-paste entries of URLs.   o New resource autoPlaceWindows; if set to False, new document    view windows will not be automatically positioned by the    program itself (but its still up to your window manager just how    theyre placed).   o Command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new    resource initialWindowIconic can also be used).   o Gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof.   o Obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in IMG tag fixed.   o Eliminated nonintuitive error message when image cant be read    (inlined NCSA bitmap is indication enough that somethings not    right for authors, and readers cant do anything about bad images    in any case).   o Obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <ADDRESS><A    HREF=...>text<A></ADDRESS>) fixed.   o Fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits Suns.   o Fixed stupid coredump on URLs like ://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/.   o Fixed buglet in handling rlogin URLs.   o New support for Solaris/SYSVR4 (courtesy    dana@thumper.bellcore.com).   o Better support for HP-UX 8.x and 9.x (courtesy    johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com).   o Better support for NeXT (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk).   o Some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy    bingle@cs.purdue.edu).   o Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups.

The summary describes Fresco (formerly known as XC++) as an X consortium effort. Without doing a complete review of the paper, Ill just mention the goals as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the Xt toolkit or Xlib. Features they want in FRESCO lightweight Objects, such as Interviews Glyphs Structured Graphics Resolution independence Natural C++ programming interface edit-in-place embedding distributed user interface components Multithreading  This by no means captures the complete content of the paper.

These players all are pretty good players.  They are the depth that the dynasties had to win Stanley Cups.  They tend to be the very good second line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL. They were all important to their clubs.  Probably, several of these Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it were not for the depth provided by these players.  They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.  As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That doesnt mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could dominate games with his defence.  He didnt need to get goals to dominate. He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been anyone any better at doing this.  Not ever.  Gregmeister ",0,rec.sport.hockey

Actually, fired-coach George Kingston was a third of the GM triumvirate.  Now that the trio is now duo (Dean Lombardi and Chuck Grillo), the Sharks are already on their 3rd ""office of the GM"". And a 4th is likely to happen before September; theyll either add the new coach to the OofGM, or name a single GM. So your wager should be amended to read that Sharks are likely to have their 5th GM before the Panthers get their 2nd. Cant wait to see how the next seasons NHL Guide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks.  Given the depth of next years draft, the expansion draft rules, and the reputation of their GMs, Anaheim and Miami look pretty good as the first 90s expansion teams to win a Cup.  San Jose and Ottawa have instability at the GM position, something that Philly, NYI, Edmonton, and Calgary did not have when they won their first Cups. Pittsburgh did, but they needed a quarter century. --  Mike Eisler, mre@Eng.Sun.Com  ``Not only are they [Leafs] the best team, but  their fans are even more intelligent and insightful than Pittsburghs.

Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesnt quite fit if youre Montreal.

Blaming Stewart is just an excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides, Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.  Montreal played a solid game (although they still dont know how to clear traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).  Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I dont think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to  play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakics shot.  Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this article, if possible.  >Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and >on his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldnt have >gone in.  I didnt think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didnt think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (cant remember who) in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldnt have gone in regardless.  >Oh well, at least the Bruins lost in O.T. also Ha, Ha!!--)  Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilnys goal with five seconds left in the second, IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.  Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I havent seen a team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red  Army.    But I still hate the team.  On the rest of thepowerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit.  Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know somethings up.  New Jersey was overmatched, Terreris heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is unbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I  hate that team anyway.    dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca (pissed-off Habs fan)    ",0,rec.sport.hockey

There is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just a little over a decade ago, and noone showed up for the early rounds in the playoffs...whereas soon after they went to the divisional set-up arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds.    The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will show up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the Bruins play the Captials in the first round.  Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will no longer be the case.

Nope, its not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to  purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of thea) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two suchThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any  organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions  to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL.  - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.   By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.  >And no, Im not going to even think of buying one.  Im not that crazy.  Why not? Its a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies.

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.  This is basically a release which drops the gamma status. Next release will incorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support X11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.  Note to all of those who keep copies of thedistribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.  Here is the original HISTORY  The University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation, has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++ classes. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1. However, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only worked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no longer actively supported by the University of Lowell.  I, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell  bindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).  NEW RELEASE  I am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++ bindings.   This release - Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support - Support for Xbae widgetset  - Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate   progress in an application. - Imake support.		     and its config files on your site. I have tried to 		     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable 		     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely 		     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you 		     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma 		     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude 		     of platforms to test the Imake-files on. - Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs) - An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted   on Usenet.  WHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS Anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11. Please be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large files during working hours.  Also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this is an old version of the bindings. Those who dont have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by e-mail.  REQUEST  Those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please contact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-).

Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross  section are determined from a series of observations made with a high- power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data  processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of  orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail  echoes or lightning atmospherics.

In International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program. Handbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 p Publication      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere  troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar  features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large  VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed  to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier  feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast  beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the  antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal  division/combination are performed at a low signal level using  electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna  beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the  zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element  is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful  calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna  element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for  this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to  make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern  monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific  satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna  Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400  watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement  and results are discussed.

A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent  scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000  km altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in  Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The  system is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array  configuration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been  in successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about  3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective  antenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of  the MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam  steering within 20 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar,  a variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of  the radar controller. A brief description of the system configuration  is presented.

" Ed Campion Headquarters, Washington, D.C.                             April 23, 1993 ( Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center, Houston ( HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS  	The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed.  	The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the Shuttles robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions.  	""Basically what weve done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,"" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. ""It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.""  	In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission.  	""When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,"" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight Director for the mission.  	While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.  	""We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"" Heflin said.  ""In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.""  	Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone underwater training ""runs"" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.  	Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.  	Endeavours June flight and Discoverys July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.  	Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers.  	Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.  	The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary.  - end -      ___    _____     ___     /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the  Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The  satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section  housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof  mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The  proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation  pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered  around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.       TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The  2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a  single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be  powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

" I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but hes clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, hes only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided  to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be MVP, but Id prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the leagues premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the  rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that well let in fewer goals than Hartford.

" Some one asked me recently why they when they used XQueryBestCursor to see if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could, but the server did not create cursors of that size. Investigation showed that some X servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, while others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thing to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware - a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while a Sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far Ive also seen this behavior on NCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs.  Actually, the NCD is even more liberal - sizes much larger then the root winodw are gladly returned as OK. Is XQueryBestCursor semi-broken or is this behavior correct?

Sorry, but olwm and tvtwm dont do it. They place the title at that position and the window at a position below it.  This becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current configuration and restore is later.  Currently, my solution 	XCreateWindow(...); 	XSetWMProperties(..); 	XMapWindow(...); 	XFlush(...); 	XMoveWindow(...);   It works with olwm, but is less than elegant. All this leaves me wondering if Im overlooking something obvious.  Richard.  ",2,comp.windows.x

" I have the following problem on X11R5 servers.  When a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has the Save Under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored.  Normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window that obscured my window, no expose event is sent.  When ExposureMask is set for the child windows, those windows are correctly updated when the popup window disappears, however then the application gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws.  Everything works fine with X11R4.  Is this something that is changed between X11R4 and X11R5 (obvious)? Is it something I do wrong? Is there something that the popup window should do (which is also mine)? Is this a bug in X11 release 5?

" What would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (Martin Mariatta, Boeing, Mcdonell Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Rockwell) getting together, and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles, and spending say $3million to do that.  Recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle  ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure out how many, how often, where to, etc...)  Then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I know... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft designs.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to  eliminate designs that cant be built today.  And lets say that this portion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.  And from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall street, and saying ""I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers that show %20 ROI, fund me...)   Now many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority that just this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS, ALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european spirit of initial cooperation.  They have also learned that design requirements that are phony (I.E. some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be) ends up getting chopped up in congress, because it is not a REAL requirement.

" ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	The xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window  or the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window.  The file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr  client and your local printing mechanism. You can use this		csh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd & and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current display will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an undocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the  command-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for  specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]  	Two publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of  arbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc. There are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92] is the most recent. 	xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders  XPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr; see xsnap-pl2.tar.Z. 	A screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z.soft-eng@cs.uwm.edu. 	xprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.  	To post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr, which is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps and XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for  use in presentations (seecontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive servers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.  	The XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and save it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities. 	Bristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter  2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net in vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.  	ColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen- capture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and  non-PostScript printers.  	Some vendors implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows)  include session managers or other desktop programs which include ""print portion of screen"" or ""take a snapshot"" options. Some platforms also have tools which  can be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example,  have a screendump program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals  have local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.  	Some vendors implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct  support for printing xwd files, but youll typically need some other package  to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	If you need color PostScript in particular, you can  	- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color  PostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv  	- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS. You can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick  distribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	This cant be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider  instead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	The likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzers useful++  Portable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting  among various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps,  gray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently; the most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z. 	Another tool is San Diego Supercomputing Centers IMtools (imconv in  particular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary. Its available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).  	Useful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frosts xloadimage, a version of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are  later versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.   Graeme Gills updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export;  see xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.  	xv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley),  can read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF,  GIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on thecontrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned  formats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on  it, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92;  see the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  	The Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>. Conversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available via FTP asand 	The Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads and writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image manipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as contrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.  	The Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar  to PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as 	Xim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential  interactive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is  a version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and  Motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif,  xwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a library and command-line utilities for building your own applications.  	ImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from  exports contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display images on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF from other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.  	xtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written to handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining simple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems with building pixmaps and using different visual classes.

A solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a		echo ""ESC]2;TEXT^G"" where ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed, and ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).  	Here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change		alias newcd cd \!*; echo -n ESC]2\;$cwd^G  	The digit 2 in these strings indicates to xterm that it should  change only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name  used in the icon, use the digit 0 instead, and use 1 to change only the  icon name.the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the escape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.a ^V.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file  ctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.  OReillys Volume 3, the X Users Guide, includes an R5 version of the control  sequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of  the book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences. [1/93]  Other good sources of information include the R4 version of that document and also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a  compilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100  sequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was  published in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).  In a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.

If you give  a resource specification like		xterm*then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to 80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size.  But its popup menus dont; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it		xterm* ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	You could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command.  However, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for  manipulating the selection will help; e.g.  	% xselection PRIMARY | lpr finds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a  window-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties. A version is on export. 	Also available isadapted to do this.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	You can use several environment variables to control how resources are  loaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and  XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for  application-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.  	Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a  way that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies. Suppose, for example, that you are running Suns Open Windows, and you also  have some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could  set a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up  app-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your OPENWINHOME is located): 	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/% The value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see  XtResolvePathname()):          %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the                 applications class name.         %T      The value of the file ""type"".  In this case, the                 literal string ""app-defaults""         %C      customization resource (R5 only)         %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.         %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja_JP.EUC"")         %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. ""ja"")         %t      The territory part of the displays language string         %c      The codeset part of the displays language string  	Lets take apart the example.  Suppose the applications class name is  ""Myterm"". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the  example omits locale-specific lookup.) 	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm 	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm  	As the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above  app-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it  and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to  search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.  	Lets consider another example. This time, lets set  XUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working  directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults. 	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./% 	The first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands  to $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging  because it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file  Myterm.ad in the applications source directory, so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly.for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and %S are useless.  	With R5, theres another twist.  You may specify a customization  resource value.  For example, you might run the ""myterm"" application like	myterm -xrm ""* 	If one of your pathname specifications had the value ""/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C"" then the expanded pathname would be ""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color"" because the %C substitution character  takes on the value of the customization resource.  	The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt,		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N  	(this batch of default settings.)  	The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is  		<root>/%L/%N%		<root>/%l/%N%		<root>/%N%		<root>/%L/%		<root>/%l/%		<root>/% 	<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the users home directory  if XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other  than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.  	Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find  your app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR  to ""."", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3  compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to ""./"", a dot followed  by a slash.

You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script; or you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or, if you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your  .xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting your .xsession file off with ""#!/bin/csh"".

One solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It  includes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and xrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine. A more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar. 	One solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from 132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and $DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then  propagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain 		eval `xrlogind` where xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special  format it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to  recreate the environment variables. [11/90]  	In addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on  another host, and you find 		rsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY  too simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh  can be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be  		xrsh <HOST> xterm    #! /bin/sh   # start an X11 process on another host   #  #   # rsh $host -n ""setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null""   #   # An improved  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)   #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)   #   # but they put the rcmd in ()s which left zombies again.

See Ollie Joness article in the November 91 X  Journal for more information. 	The R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained  a number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor. 	An easier way is to use the ""xfed"" client to modify an existing font; a version is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is  available for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63],  possibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce BDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers. 	The xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors, XPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in /pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed  [5/91] in	If you are a MetaFont user you can use ""mftobdf"" from the SeeTeX distribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.

The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the  same depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because  of this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since  there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore,  neither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap  converter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a  resource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for  use in many of its widgets, however. [courtesy Chris D.

For Gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension only, either MIT-SHM to do the shade in an image and fast update the window with it, or PEX/OpenGL which should be able to shade themselves. The portable vanilla X way would be to shade in a normal XImage and use XPutImage(), what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes or such stuff.

" Sterrenkundig symposium Compacte Objecten                                              op 26 april 1993   In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun oervader middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtsecompacte objecten, de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven tetechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd.

" ------- Blind-Carbon-Copy 4/06/ NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. April 6, 1993         Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.          A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.          Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the Presidents new technology investment.  As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.          Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.          Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.          To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.          Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""

Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.  ------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy ",1,sci.space

" Well, I gotta tell ya,  last nights Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU! It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the Don and Ron it was the an ""off-night"" for the Leafs and the Devils  were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....  IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the credit away from Gilmour).  I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY?  Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet, Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs fare when they are once again ""healthy"" if they are playing this well so far??  Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence, moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, havent lost at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc. (BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvins first shut-out? I cant  remember him having any as of yet.)  Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to see this one?)  Coming to the stretch and still a ROARIN!!!!!

Cant believe people actually put >win as first in a tie breaker......  Golly, I love stupid people. :-) Listen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL, there exist these things called ""ties"".  A tie occurs when a game ends with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie.  There also exits these things called ""wins"".  A win is when one team has a higher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other at a time, so I can say ""the opponent"".)  A team gets two points for a win.  So, lets say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10 ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86 points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  Thats amazing.  So, Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then thats what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the tiebreaker and therefore have the ""better"" record, even though both teams had the same number of points.  If you didnt understand this post, Rex, maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly. :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)  --     Keith Keller				LETS GO RANGERS!!!!!

"  I am currently attempting to get a copy of the HP Widget set compiled under Linux (SLS Release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some problems.  Actually, it seems that this is more of a GCC question, because I got it to compile without trouble using cc on an RS/6000. 	Basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes set up in, lets say, CompositeP.h, for instance, the composite widgets insert_child procedure is set up with the type :  	typedef void (*XtWidgetProc) (Widget)  but in several places in the HP source code, they reference the insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just one, as the prototype suggests.  For 	(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)  Now, GCC chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments are passed to the function.  So, does anyone have any suggestions as to how to turn off this checking in GCC, or how I can go about changing the code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/X11/CompositeP.h, or has anyone successfully built the HP widget set and have any suggestions.

Mario Lemieux is the explanation, IMHO.    >You could make a case that the *expectation* of an improving team that >would make the playoffs is the reason.   Funny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make.  >But I think the reason is Lemieux >had a 168 point season and was the first non-Gretzky to win the Hart and >Ross since 1980.  People turned out to watch him play.   I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks.  But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase  will last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking one.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support them.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, youd have knee surgery for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.    >Also, the following year (88-89) the Pens had 89 points not 87.   Ok.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book.   >They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is  >true.  But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing >this (Coffey late in 1987) and before they even had a playoff bound team. >A doubling of attendance occured in 1984-85 from the previous year.  An >increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival >of Mario Lemieux is what did it.   You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that it wasnt Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e. a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And before anybody jumps in and says Im nit-picking and mincing words, go back and read from where this thread started...  It might help to think about what would go through a fans mind who suddenly found an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it ""gee, Mario Lemieux is amazing, Ill go watch him play"", or was it ""gee, now weve got a *kick* *ass* guy on *our* side, Ill go watch him play"".  I think it was the latter.  > Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before >Gretzkys arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.  They >are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement >since Gretzkys first year there.  How do you explain it?  People are going >to see Gretzky.  they certainly arent going to see a winner, they havent >GOT a winner.  Theyve had MUCH better teams in their past history than >they currently have, yet they didnt draw as well then.  I dont think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people dont go to the games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket holders in LA dont always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings initial success following Gretzkys arrival (68 to 91 points, same source) and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.    Whether or not the Kings are a winner is debatable.  I claim that since Gretzkys arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler dynasty...but thats another story and included only because I dont likethat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising sales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the Forum even if the tickets were sold.  >I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend >winning as the major drawing power.    For the short term, IMO.  Although I think that its inevitable that the team will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they make people around them better.  >But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)  Well, at least we are in full agreement here!  >This does not make Rogers point any more valid, but the Jets arent  So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldnt resist...>  >getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge >jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne. >They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isnt because >they are winning.  Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people showing up at Winnipeg games.  Its difficult to predict, but do you think that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they will maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that case the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without Selanne.  I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the  CFL...did you leave it out because you dont know much about the CFL?

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital velocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth, you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community.  It sounds like a good Science Fair project--Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics. Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussedon the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000 for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers, or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.  Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.

"  Here is a press release from the White House.   Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19; Q&A Following    WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine ""Black Bears"" NCAA Division I hockey                            The Rose Garden      THEan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And were glad to have them here.       Im inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory.       Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978.  Im sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today.       You know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We dont have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  Its a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though, theres a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)       In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I cant imagine.  (Laughter.)  Im actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me.       On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about.       Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind.       I think its important, as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives.       We now have another role model, and Im glad to have them here today.  (Applause.)       (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.)       THE(Applause.)       (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)       THE                              * * * * * *       Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco this morning, sir?       THEGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI.       Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed?       THEThat was their judgment, the FBI.       Q  Is this a raid?       THEtalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions.       Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning?       Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?       THEquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).       SENATOR      THEMitchell, hes worth a quarter any day.       Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?       THEthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings were going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed wed get back together later, around noon, and talk some more.       Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise.       THEDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I dont want to go back and revisit every one, but you   can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position theyre taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for dont have much of a history on which to base their position.  Theyve got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think weve got a chance to work it out, and Im hopeful. Well see what happens today and tomorrow.  Im feeling pretty good about it.

It is much easier to be an element of change  Hardly.  The ""established"" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al. The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team could successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop- olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth- er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly debatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de- bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe and his pals showed up.  >or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates >a new situation.  If you want to honor players like Bobby Orr than Im sure >you can find a reason to name a torphy after him such as best offensive  >defenseman.  Whats wrong with best defenceman, period?

"  Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.   The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building, and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience.  I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun. At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work, but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),  The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe). The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres.  The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long.  All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile.    The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing, the projectile vaporizes.  The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles.  The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s, and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but I havent had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).  There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.  This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit.

I think the three-headed GMs guiding principle was to keep veterans in favor of youngsters only if they offered a ""significant"" advantage. At the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhat maginal contributions (Fenton, Bozek, Anderson, and a couple others I cant remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters could play almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these older guys did not.  And they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he wasnt good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic in thinking they could make up for his contributions. An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis but not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent contributor worth keeping around.  The youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around. But you have to find the right balance. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Steve Cole  (steve@sep.stanford.edu, apple!sep!steve) Department of Geophysics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305 ",0,rec.sport.hockey

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool.  Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... Both Dionnes and Bellows shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head  for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from  end-to-end. Kamenskys mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by  Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall  for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero  because Roys team didnt make full use of their opportunities.  Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very  well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over  Bellows stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all  those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them. Hextall wasnt particularly brilliant on those plays ...   >Blaming Stewart is just an >excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst >goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.  >Montreal played a solid game (although they still dont know how to clear >traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more).   I disagree. Roy played well because he wasnt screened the whole night.  The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic, Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.  >Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than  >five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME  >ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads. But I dont >think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear  >the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).    This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities, as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.  >Roy is paid big money to  >play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakics shot.  And Hextall didnt on Dionnes goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5, when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him for most of the season.  >Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let >the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this >article, if possible.  The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of ""Burnsian"" hockey to shut down Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the  extra 2.  Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. Thats a guaranteed way to end the series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ? The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.  >I didnt think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didnt >think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (cant remember who) >in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldnt have gone in >regardless.  If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never have been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the puck up under Roys arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.  Yaska  ! yaska@eecg.toronto.edu !

" Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have affected the AHL this year.   ST JOHNS MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS The St Johns Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by problems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but off ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the leafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of the seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played ""home"" games in places like Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff ""home"" games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One demostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs bus and rocked it and broke windows in the St Johns Memorial Stadium. Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs will return to St Johns once the strike ends. =================================================== SENATORS SOLD The New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to the Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian NHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear they intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic Provinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL head office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting in May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it  clear the league was more interested in the stability of the  AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining the 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven.   The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown New Brunswick and are expected to move there. ================================================== DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out of Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind.   The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.  Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining 6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks in the New Brunswick city.  The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold 1400 for this year. ============================================================ SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of Saint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200 Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble. ========================================================= CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE Despite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore Skipjacks to Maine. The Caps current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks, announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates. There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced a limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players including 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders. ====================================================== AHL GAME OF THE WEEK In early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced by, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian Maritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of the week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there has been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and shown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic Sports Network in Canada (but Im not sure about that). I am not sure if playoff games will be covered. ===================================================== UTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED? There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next season. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern city and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them. ===================================================== WHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR  ONE OPTION				ANOTHER OPTION 			 Northern Division			Southern Division ADIRONDACK RED WINGS			ADIRONDACK SPRINGFIELD INDIANS			SPRINGFIELD PROVIDENCE BRUINS			PROVIDENCE CD ISLANDERS				CDI PORTLAND PIRATES			HERSHEY 					BINGHAMTON Southern Division			ROCHESTER HERSHEY BEARS				HAMILTON BINGHAMTON RANGERS			UTICA ROCHESTER AMERICANS HAMILTON CANUCKS			Atlantic Division UTICA (?)

Since I give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized, I made a translation table for the Expose & Configure events. The Expose event calls my redraw method while the Configure event calls my rescale method.  The rescale method invokes a ""fake"" Expose event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate Expose struct) to draw the data.  Quest 1. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R4 (running in either R4 or R5 env.) I get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed.  I assume Im getting cascading events.  Is that right? Any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?  Quest 2. When the appl. is compiled/linked w/ R5 I get no Expose events whatsoever.  Do events and/or translation tables act differently in R5?

"    The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period and the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium. Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17 seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals. Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the stretch to preserve the Blues lead.  The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and taking a 1-0 lead on Noonans first goal. Right after an interference penalty on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Josephs pads. After the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks 10-9 in the first period.  Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 atthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.  Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at Noonan completed his hat trickStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan deflected the puck in the net.  Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 atrebound of Basil McRaes slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.  With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 atup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for The Blues didnt waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot, and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp angle.  Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.  The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy Murray point blank from just right of the crease withThe Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period, totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent in the game.

" Way back in the early years (~50s) it took 8 wins to garner the Stanley Cup.  Soooooo, a couple of local fish mongers (local to the Joe Louis Arena, that is) started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win.  After each victory, one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the ice.  (They are dead by the way.)

" As the Sharks season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts, trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through for the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can kill them.  I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course, are subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as possible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks and/or did not play for another NHL team this season.  Thus, then, lets go to the goaltenders...  #1	BRIAN HAYWARD It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that featured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in 87, 88, and 89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.  But Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks first ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames. As he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.  #30	JEFF HACKETT Hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply wasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles, almost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save percentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the teams #1 goalie to bench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor, but upon return, he simply wasnt up to the task.  He may not return next year.  #31	WADE FLAHERTY It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary Flames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started the season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP honors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he tries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up all-star honors along with Irbe; now its time for him to show that he can share the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor Robins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesnt make it next year, he may not ever.  #32	ARTURS IRBE I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that hes a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting the teams first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26. He has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and making passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the goonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for a playoff spot next season, Irbes the key, as he demonstrated in being named as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.  =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!

" Here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral exploration.  Basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth.. You think this is crazy. Well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.  There is a billin the congress to do just that.. Basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends  of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and other expenses you can owe more than what you made. BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe 600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks..   Basically to get back to my beginning statement, is space is the way to go cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the eco-freaks or the protectionist..

(It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing  - low viscosity --- if its too difficult to force the fluid in & out      of the lungs, you cant extract enough oxygen to power your own     breathing effort (let alone anything else)    - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isnt expelled     is the part thats nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)     So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen     tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.    - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough     gas per unit volume.

" I finally got it back, with great thanks to Mark Spiegel for saving and sending it.    #2	ROB ZETTLER Zettler gave the Sharks every bit hes got this year; unfortunately, this still wasnt enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer, if that.  He works hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #3	DAVID WILLIAMS IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in 91-92, playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City, was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that 91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the playmaking skills that made him the teams leading scorer among defensemen last year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.  #4	JAYSON MORE After being touted as the teams top defensive prospects in training camp before 91-92, More had a rather disappointing 91-92, as he was not particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then, proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the teams most reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash. Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73 games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.  #5	NEIL WILKINSON Wilkinson was probably the teams top defensive defenseman in 91-92.  However, partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25 games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners; that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.  #6	SANDIS OZOLINSH At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers), Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the teams MVP.  A serious knee injury in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games), but he still finished as the teams top scorer among defensemen (23 points), which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinshs abilities.  At the time, he was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still susceptible to so-called ""rookie mistakes,"" but was probably the defenseman who made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.  #19	DOUG ZMOLEK Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didnt show it (15 points). He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.  =============================================================================== GO CALGARY FLAMES!

However, you may be speaking of ""Public Missle, Inc."", which is a legitimate company that has been around for a while.  Due to advances in composite fuels, engines are now available for model rockets using similar composites to SRB fuel, roughly 3 times more  powerful than black powder motors.

The engines range from D all the way to M in common manufacture, N and O Ive heard of used at special occasions.

(lost my roster list) on Hammerby? Does it look like >they will make it to the Eliteserien for next year? And then get stomped >if Markus goes to Boston? >  Well Matt, Mattias Timmander hasnt been playing with the MoDo elite league  team yet (just the MoDo junior team), so I predict he needs a few more years  here before he can join the Bs. I saw him play in the Swedish championship  game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,  but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to  have a Ulf type-of-player on the Bs team too? :)  As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in  division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,  and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is  considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is  Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play  in Elitserien next season, unless the Bs can get him of course.  I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to  watch in Swedish hockey this season.

BRUINS IN 5.  Im hoping for a Fuhr miracle, but I agree that Boston will likely win the series.

Jersey has a decent team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.  >Pittsburgh vs.>If the Caps had Bill Ranford I might see an upset, but Don Beaupre >just doesnt inspire my hopes.  PENGUINS IN 6.  I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I dont think it will go six either...*maybe* five.  >CONFERENCE>Pittsburgh vs.>A replay of last year. The Penguins are just as good as 12 months ago, >and the Bruins are much improved. But... PENGUINS IN 6.  If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They own the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once again I wont be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.  >Campbell Conference, Norris Division, semifinal  >Chicago vs. St. Louis (or Minnesota): > BLACKHAWKS IN 5.  Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good, IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.  >Detroit vs.>The Leafs have had an excellent season, but theyve been playing >playoff hockey all year - the Habs under Burns were the same way and >always wilted in the playoffs.  RED WINGS IN 5.  Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three  at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.  >>Chicago vs.> This will be a war. Fedorov will win it in OT. RED WINGS IN 7.  It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all.  And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.  >Smythe Division >Vancouver vs.> CANUCKS IN 7.  Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They dont use their size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.  >Calgary vs. Los>This would have been tough to call, except for three things. 1/ The >Kings dont have a goalie; 2/ Gary Roberts will be back; 3/ the Kings >shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner (Paul Coffey) >for a proven loser (Jimmy Carson). Gretzky is just too weary to carry >this group. FLAMES IN 5.  This is also tough for me to call, because I havent seen the Smythe enough.  I dont think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate Gretzky.  LA in six.  >>Vancouver vs.> FLAMES IN 6.  If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.  >COFERENCE>Detroit vs.> RED WINGS IN 7.  Wow, mustve been tough to go against your team.  But lets see, I picked LA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.  >STANLEY CUP>Pittsburgh vs.>Three in a row and official dynasty status for the Pens? Or can the >Wings complete a dream season? Well, the Wings are better in goal (not >sufficiently so though IMHO) and have better D-men. However, Mario and >the boys can sure score. Look for Jagr to shine in the playoffs, >though I sure would love to see Probert beat some sense into him. The >Pens are just too much, especially since Detroit will have a tougher >battle to get here. PENGUINS IN 5.  If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldnt bet against the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong because theyve been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose, though, Id have to take the Penguins.  A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team. Im not asking for flames, either, btw....Ive spent more than enough time arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say hes a great player.  But while he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge), Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp. from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud your judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best all-round players in the NHL.    dchhabra@stpl.ists.ca ",0,rec.sport.hockey
" Reported yesterday in the Washington Post (Kathy Sawyer, writer):  The article plays down the Russian role in US space.  Gibbons (science advisor to Clinton) sent Goldin a letter indicating NASA should not limit redesign options to those compatible with Mir orbit.  The White House thinks expectations for Russian cooperation have been raised too high.  The article reports that some think the spending and schedule limits for space station are so stringent that the redesign is nearly impossible.  Thats why some think Goldin has begun looking at  Russian hardware.  Goldin states NASA will present all options to the administration  which will then have decision making power.  Goldin and the White House have totally ruled out using Energia to boost the station. --  Chuck Divine ",1,sci.space

" Some time back I asked for software recommendations to  allow me to run X from my PC at home to my Sparc at the office.  Many thanks for all replies, the majority of people  recommended PCXremote from NCD. I received it yesterday  and installed it on my Sparc and PC with only one hitch.  The UNIX install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory.  On the PC side, I ordered the WINDOWS version  which  came with a slick windows installation.   The only problem I had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory had the line DISPLAY=`hostname`:0.0; export DISPLAY  s.t the clients I kicked off connected to my Xserver on the Sparc console. By removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned and the clients connected to the server at  `hostname`:1.0  Some comments on performance, I was connected to a Sparc 2 thru a NetBlazer Terminal Server over a 9600 baud line.

Because the window manager does not know about this, you cannot move, resize etc. it. xv in the mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested but you never get to see it because VUEs window is overlaid on top of the root window.

These   are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the   performance of your workstation.    Well, more hardware isnt always an option, and I wonder if more   hardware is always even a necessity.    This ""FAQ"" list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different   people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from X   Windows on your workstation, WITHOUT PURCHASING MORE HARDWARE.    Performance is a highly subjective issue.  The individual user must   balance `speed versus `features in order to come to a personal   decision.  Therefore this document can be be expected to contain many   subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.    This document is specifically concerned with X.  There are of course   many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.   However, they are outside the scope of this document.      [ People seriously interested in the whole area of system     performance, might want to look at the OReilly Nutshell Handbook     ""System Performance Tuning"" by Mike Loukides.  Im about 25% of the     way through reading it, and it looks like a well-written     comprehensive treatment of system performance.

If you are reading a copy of this FAQ which is more than a few   months old (see the ""Last-modified"" date above) you should probably   locate the latest edition, since the information may be outdated.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and   well written ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" document.   Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates   on performance.    The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with   regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to	""Use X11R5, it is faster than R4"".   (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).  --------------- Window Managers ---------------    There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different   features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a   balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this   point, most respondents have agreed upon ""twm"" as the best candidate   for a speedy window manager.     A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,   is turning off unnecessary things like ""zooming"" and ""opaque move"".   Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the   amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping   windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    Ive found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is   the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)   and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the   display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.  ------------ The X Server ------------  Which Server? - - - - - - -   Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.   If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.    On my Monochrome Sun, I havent noticed much difference between   the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to   me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute   to less paging.            [ thanks                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]    How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law   (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be   compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.   You can expect to get ""*very* large speedups in the server"" by not   using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results   would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial   compilers on the market.  Locking the Server into RAM? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and   does not get paged?  performance at all?  Ive had one inquiry on this topic, and a few   pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone   whos tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.   			  [thanks				      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be), 				      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ] Starting your Server - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep     for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my     .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...     we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.    This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!      Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of   why this works, which I have summarized     When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to     start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by     the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of     pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the     server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you     put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself     sorted out before the clients start up.      Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X     client program    being fetched, programs initializing state and ""databases"" and so     forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this     initialization is done (""The process has reached a steady state""),     the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.     By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your     .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your     workstations limited resources    This is most definitely a ""Your Mileage May Vary"" situation, as there   are so many variables to be  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients   you are starting, etc.    Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &    Ive experimented	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 3; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &    Ive even	(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &   and then in start_X_clients_script I	(sleep 1; exec xclock ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) & 	(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &      [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had     completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down     into a ""steady state"" before the sleep expired and all my clients     were launched. ]    All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with   my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to   experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.  Fonts - - -   Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts   your applications use, youll get speed increases in load-up time.    One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one   large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or   at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.   Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded   into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer   fonts will be loaded by the server.

Since   I dont normally use 8x13, Ive eliminated one font from my server.    Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):     Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.     If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.  About the Resources File - - - - - - - - - - - - -      Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves     on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)    One     In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum     number of resources that you want to have available to all of your     applications.  For     Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific     resource files.  For    .login file set the environment variable 	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N      [ The ""comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions"" FAQ contains     an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.     --ed.]      So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from     .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,     and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same     XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system     app-defaults directory (    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files     with the same name.      This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666). 		    [Thanks		         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov), 		             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu). 	     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]    This method of organizing your personal resources has the following     - Easier to maintain / more usable.      - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER       property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally       quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.      - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort        through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.    It also has     - the application that you are interested in has to load an       additional file every time it starts up.  This doesnt seem to       make that much of a performance difference, and you might       consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an       applications resource database, you just need to re-run the       application without having to ""xrdb"" again.      - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When       your resources are split out into multiple resource files and       then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.       WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!        I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped       out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource       files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why       my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*       provide any error message when it encountered the C style       comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted       processing the resource file.        The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef       COLOR ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this       method of resource management.      - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For       example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their       resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.      - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files       with the machine where your resources are stored, your client       will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the       server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find       their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)    A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)   is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (  .Xdefaults file, and to use the ""separate resources files"" method for   clients that I seldom use.  Define Your Display Properly - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In   that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to    ""<hostname>:0.0"", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you   should set your DISPLAY variable to ""  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same   machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.

Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)    [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change   stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.

Hopefully MIT   will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.

Think also   about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For  a smaller clock program than xclock?    Unfortunately, I havent really noticed that programs advertise how large   they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.    [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients   (   Ive received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject   of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are   strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather   large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using   may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In   this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually   _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.    The upshot of all this seems to  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif   clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then youre dragging in   more than one toolkit library.    Know your environment, and think carefully about which client   programs would work best together in that environment.

If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines   to reduce memory usage.

UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with    Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He    questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For    instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling    speed (try this quickie   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm    may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We dont have any hard    numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text    segments mean that xterms paging requirements are not that major.     As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it    made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets    brought into memory.     So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of    xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.

From Scott Barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding Motif   Text Field     I noticed that during data entry into Motif text field widgets, I     was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes,     particularly the initial one in the field.  Examining the what was     going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource     XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget     (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.     Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the     widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user     can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not     noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference     on a [slower system].    This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots   of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor   embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server   requests?  ------------------------- Miscellaneous Suggestions -------------------------  Pretty Pictures - - - - - - - -   Dont use large bitmaps (GIFs, etc) as root window backgrounds.    - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server     is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)    - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and Im     conscious of performance issues, I cant comprehend it when I see     people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.      Ill let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by     having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.    - If youre anything like me, you need all the screen real estate     that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.

""xset m 0 10 &""       }  Programming Thoughts - - - - - - - - - - -   Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :     To speed up applications that youre developing, there are tons of     things you can do.  Some that stick     - For Motif programs, dont set XmFontList resources for individual       buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or       labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager       widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.      - Better yet, dont use Motif at all.  Its an absolute pig.      - Dont create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.       (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)      - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE       difference.      - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the       difference between a fast application and a completely unusable       one.    Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :     Just a small    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based     applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying     out the GNUY malloc, but I didnt find the time yet. I did some     tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the     differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)    [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]    Andre Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :    - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.      Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but     they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the     blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most     cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to     run through its event-loop again and again.    - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.      This ""Gfx Context Switching"" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,     where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed     again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching     and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will     remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the     connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).

Not really a     major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in     absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.    Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :     Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPUs are mostly idle, Xs     cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate     doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they     are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your     action.      The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2     cpus halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going     over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved     buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing     even fewer context switches.  ---------------------------- Other Sources of Information ----------------------------    Volume 8 in OReillys X Window System Series, ``X Window System   Administrators Guide is a book all X administrators should read.

" There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of todays LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought Id post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the ""Space Age"" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, ""Whats New"" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - its clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation ofits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our ""mind children"" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*.     Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...   SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW  Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)  At 35, Americas Space Age wont have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis.  The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards.    Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of Americas science and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy.    To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.  .....  Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station Freedom alone.  Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much.  Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets.  Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.    ......  While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of Americas technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions its competitiveness agenda.  ......  ""I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen now,"" says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASAs Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena.  ""Weve put off a lot of things we shouldnt have.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a $40-billion one filled with white elephants."" ",1,sci.space
"  Sorry for asking a question thats not entirely based on the technical aspects of space, but I couldnt find the answer on the FAQs !  Im currently in the UK, which makes seeing a Space Shuttle launch a little difficult.....  However, I have been selected to be an exchange student at Louisiana State Uni. from August, and I am absolutely determined to get to see a Space Shuttle launch sometime during the year at which I will be in America.  I hear theres a bit of a long mailing list, so if someone can tell me how to get tickets and where to get them from, then please E-mail me !  Thanks very much for your patience....

" ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES, DATA, ETC.   INTRODUCTION      A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and     other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.     A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the     remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as     providing anonymous FTP. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on     the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP     directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via     email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com     or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions     on how to make requests.      The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames     SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.      Dont even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is     huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.   VIEWING IMAGES      The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly     large, and I wont attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To     read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,     use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu     (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP     sites.      The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image     formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document     is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at     pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory     pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.   ONLINE ARCHIVES      NASA AMES      Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via     anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and     a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press     releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please     note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.      FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in     pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the     archive (the index is about 200K by itself).      To access the archives by email, send a letter to     archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the     subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands 	send SPACE Index 	send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.      The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in     caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use     one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this     section for images or programs.      The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image     disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The     disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are     available in these collections.      The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory     contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in     the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is     found in the IMDISP directory (see the item ""VIEWING IMAGES"" below).      The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to     contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing     specific information. Its in MISC/media.guide.      Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee     (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).       NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM      The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and     provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data     from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140     data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can     be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS     also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,     ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to     query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,     keywords, title words, or abstract text words.      ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to     become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu.

" In article <533@imp.HellNet.org> devil@loki.HellNet.org (Gil Tene)>I am trying to figure out the current C++ toolkit ""directions"". >More simply, Id like to know which C++ toolkit to ""bet on""  >for use in a new long term project.  I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++, and a few variations on the above.  Ive also done a cursory examination of Rogue Waves View.h++.  I like View.h++s abstractions best of all of the toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance, but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks promising, but I havent found a free version with Motif support, and Im not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted, and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.  At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry directions.  Its better to take a standard if inferior solution for now than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only library Id consider right now, but in our environment, wed end up spending nearly $5000 to use it, and I cant justify it when its likely to cause short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits at the high end of the J curve.  - Brad --  Brad Daniels		`	|  ""If money cant buy happiness, daniels@neosoft.com		|   I guess Ill have to rent it.""

" Ive just read Richard Langleys latest ""Navstar GPS Constellation Status"".  It states that the latest satellite was placed in Orbit Plane Position C-3. There is already one satellite in that position. I know that its almost ten years since that satellite was launched but its still in operation so why not use it until it goes off?  Why not instead place the new satellite at B-4 since that position is empty and by this measure have an almost complete GPS-constellation (23 out of 24)?  /Thomas ================================================================================ Ericsson Telecom, Stockholm, Sweden        Thomas Enblom, just another employee.

See the discussion of ""high-power rocketry"" in the rec.models.rockets frequently-asked-questions list.  This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need proper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high- power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.  You need special FAA authorization, but provided you arent doing it under one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, its not especially hard to arrange.  As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty air to fly in, but its basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry. --  All work is one mans work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry ",1,sci.space

"   1993 World Championships in ====================================   Group A  SWEDEN - CANADA  1-4 (0-0,1-1,0-3)      SWE 1-1 Patrik Juhlin        (Jan Larsson)      CAN 1-3 Mike Gartner         (Greg Johnson,Adam Graves)      CAN 1-4 Rod BrindAmour      (Shayne Corson)             Shots on Sweden     10 15 12 - 37     4*2min        6,500           Rob Hearn (USA)  Canada     10 13  6 - 29     6*2min   Bill Ranford stopped 36 shots to lead Canada to a 4-1 victory in a very well  played game.   The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and  Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldnt put the puck over a sliding  Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom   played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up  Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge  to Sweden in creating more opportunities.  Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi  made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but  Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada  started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-BrindAmour worked  hard and kept the puck in the Swedes zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson  who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and  made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstroms far post, 1-0 Canada.  The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot  that hit Ranfords post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.  Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took  a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by  the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.  Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure  but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.  At cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.  That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman cant cover the puck in   the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he  explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstroms stick side, close  to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.  Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a  bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas  then and couldnt produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.  The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod BrindAmour scoring on a  rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds  in the dressing room.   A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing  great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better  than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best  goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.  Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is  easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,  Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.   The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Swedens best along with Larsson-Juhlin-  Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the  task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.  Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering  that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very  well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because  of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesmans mistake  on the 1-3 goal.

"  We developed a toolkit running on the X Window System. The toolkit copes with any languages based on X11R5s i18n facility. As you know, there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from MITs  X11R5 release -- Xsi and Ximp. Our original implementation of the toolkit uses Xsi.  Our toolkit manages each characters size based on our own font management system. In order to do that, the wchar_t typed character strings must be decomposed to character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with  ASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout and application environments locale. In this case if the locale is japanese, each wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.  We need a function to do this. The function must check how many characters from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.  We could not find any public X11R5 function to do that and inevitably, used Xsis internal functions to construct that function. The following is the source code of that function decomposeCharacterSet().   //I18N.h // This may look like C code, but it is really -*- C++ -*- // $ #ifndef _I18N_H #define _I18N_H  #include <X11/Xlib.h>  extern int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,	/* IN */ 				 int wc_len,		/* IN */ 				 char *buf,		/* OUT */ 				 int *buflen,		/* IN/OUT */ 				 int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */ 				 char **charset);	/* OUT */ extern XmString wcharToXmString(const wchar_t *wc_str); extern XmStringCharSet charsetOfWchar(const wchar_t wc);  #endif /* _I18N_H */  //I18N.cc /* $ #include <stdlib.h> #include <X11/Xlibint.h> #include <Xm/Xm.h> #include ""I18N.h""  extern ""C"" { #include <X11/wchar.h> #define _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset XXX_XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #define _Xmbfscs XXX_Xmbfscs #define _Xmbctidtocsid XXX_Xmbctidtocsid #include ""Xlocaleint.h"" #undef _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset #undef _Xmbfscs #undef _Xmbctidtocsid     extern int _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(XLocale, const wchar_t*, int, 					 char*, int*, int*, int*);     extern Charset *_Xmbfscs(XLocale, _CSID);     extern _CSID _Xmbctidtocsid(XLocale, _CSID); };  int decomposeCharacterSet(const wchar_t *wc_str,/* IN */ 			  int wc_len,		/* IN */ 			  char *buf,		/* OUT */ 			  int *buf_len,		/* IN/OUT */ 			  int *scanned_len,	/* OUT */ 			  char **charset)	/* OUT */ {     XLocale xlocale = _XFallBackConvert();     int ctid;     int status;     Charset *xcharset;          status = _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset(xlocale, wc_str, wc_len, buf, 				       buf_len, scanned_len, &ctid);     if (status == Success) { 	xcharset = _Xmbfscs(xlocale, _Xmbctidtocsid(xlocale, ctid)); 	*charset = (xcharset) ? xcharset->cs_name : NULL;     }     else 	*charset = NULL;     return status; } ----------------  An included file above, ""Xlocaleint.h"", is also Xsi internal and we copied the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.  A serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on our HP machine with its OS version of HP-UX9.01.  When we tried to link an application based on our toolkit, link errors occured saying that the following functions are    _Xmbctidtocsid (code)     _Xmbfscs (code)     _XwcDecomposeGlyphCharset (code)     _XFallBackConvert (code)  We had used MIT release version of X11R5 and its Xsi implementation until HP-UP9.0 and ran applications successfully. One of the reasons to use Xsi was that because HP did not release HPs X11R5 until the OS 9.0 and we had no way to  know how HPs R5 would be implemented. We had hoped Xsis popularity and used  its internal functions.   The HPs linker complains that there are no Xsi internal functions implemented. We observe from HPs libX11.a, they used some Ximp implementation but we are not sure if they used MITs vanilla Ximp version or their own version of Ximp and therefore, finding just counter part functions in MITs Ximp for Xsi does not seem to lead us a solution.  My question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like decomposeCharacterset() listed above. Is there any function to check character set of each element of wchar_t type strings depending on locales? If it is a public function, that is perfect but even if it is not, we want to use any internal functions in HPs X11R5 as we did for MITs R5.  In order to render a wchar_t type string, there must be some machinery to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for the string. We have no way to find out that without any HPs X11R5 source  files. We want to know how we can use that for our goal.  Any help or comments would be highly appreciated.  I also appreciate if anyone tell me about Ximp treating around this area even if it is not HPs implementation.

This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned that the NHL could expand in Europe.  Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing to play for a team in Europe?  I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level. (I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)  When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember - Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons) - Nicholls ... in Edmonton. - R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only. - C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.  I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is - Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french   fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One   players wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could   not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.  Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved to London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league (2 years ago?)

" Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For example, Why couldnt Magellan just be told to go into a ""safe"" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.    For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments ""turned off"" rather than just ""safed"".  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrats hair....    Ive heard the argument that an active but ""uncontrolled"" spacecraft causes ""radio noise.""  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed ""safe"" mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.    As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so its lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if theyre not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).     Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a ""pause"" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission ""drift"" phase.

"   To those who are wondering what is happening in   From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people  in the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St.  Paul ""Pioneer Press"" wrote an article giving the ""inside scoop"" on the  issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible  candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First theCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty  confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will  ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other  two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the  inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I cant remember his name)  believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also,  because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed  until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.   However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed,  because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for  conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to  this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future  viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even  further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of  knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging  Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met,  which may happen. 	Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are  Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota "" Ice Demons?"") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasnt  been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the  Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in  as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldnt be surprised to see  Hartford and Tampa show up there either.	So, Minnesota may end up  getting another team, but it may take a few years.  	 	Go Sabres!

Any other   The Leafs have always been kind of comical.  During the second  Imlach era, when Darryl Sittler was called a ""cancer on the team"", he tore the C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didnt have a Captain.  Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittlers friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead, Sittler got traded to Detroit.  Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.  During Doug Carpenters tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldnt take it and when they  tried to give it back to Marsh, he wouldnt take it neither.  The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be- came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.   --   cordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca                                             ""So many morons... rm                                                   ...and so little time.""

The more specific you are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.  Without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are able to respond at all.  	Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it  from. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system, give details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S  version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to  mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.  	Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the  exact transcript of your session in the message.

MITs role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and  administrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the  Consortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership,  Member (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations). 	Most of the Consortiums activities take place via electronic mail,  with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape, interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.   Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with  others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public  review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept. 	Your involvement in the public review process or as a Member or  Affiliate of the Consortium is welcomed. 	WriteScience, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.

OPEN LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF  members.   	OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;  there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications. Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the  one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce  programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlaces  (formerly Solbournes) OI, is a ""virtual toolkit"" which provides objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the users choice.  	OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising  their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.

[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92]   ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	DECWindows is a DEC product thattoolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a  session manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar,  dxpsview, etc.).  (At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.) [8/90]   ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	PEX is the ""PHiGS Extension to X"". 	PHiGS stands for ""Programmers Hierarchical Interactive Graphics  System"" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation  and manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in  hardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension  allows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized  hardware for 3D graphics. 	Sun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely  redistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample implementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release. Several vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for  their workstations and X terminals.  [last modified 10/91]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  There are several options for using X over serial SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations. Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really  ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per  packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully  so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links).   CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the  40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesnt do  anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed  data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).  PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial  line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for  running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.  XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition  to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes  redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and  using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a  pseudo-X server or ""proxy"" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There  are several advantages to doing compression outside the   (1)	You dont *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldnt  	otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly  	connected), and    (2)	It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that 	have to cross the serial interface, and    (3)	In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering  	packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for  	blocks to compress.  LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using  NCDs XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information  (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps,  etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a  Standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample  implementation available in R6.  Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/ in the following        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote         XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX  [information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]  	There is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fultons talk at the 7th MIT X Technical Conference.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways  for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape. 	twm (old): Toms Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window  managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re-parenting window manager.some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managersand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.	olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide functionality 	olwm (AT&T): dittoLisp interpreter.

It is available on archive serversavailable on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a  source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export. Version 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm. ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	It neednt.  What is probably happening is that you are running your  window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X  session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your  window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe		exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action. Your X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window,  whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	Although no known window manager directly supports such a feature -- which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the geometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something  close) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are  looking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces.  Look for the application ""xplaces"" on an archive-server near you. There are  several versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage. [10/90] 	Some new pseudo session-managers such as HPs vuewm provide for the  saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running applications and the resource database.

The X protocol, however, doesnt provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is a capability not supported by all systems. 	Some servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide command-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over  server start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the  server with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server  from MIT with the options ""-ar1 350 -ar2 30"" to reduce the sensitivity of the  keyboard.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	There is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful  for moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and  does not do ""macro expansion."" 	Some (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors,  accept a translation resource such	xterm*		<Key>which permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control characters in the string, use \nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include. 	Window managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor has a special ""remapper"" client been made available.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

It passes them by including their contents in the argument 	list, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by  	reference.  	This really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet 	supported in GNU CC, so it isnt straightforward to fix it.  	The convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and 	`-fpcc-struct-return does not help.  You can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with  compilation flags.

While  building and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid  linking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those  distributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have  LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.   If you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that  the shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or  /usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked  statically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium] 	Note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it attempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed. You can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to most C compilers).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in  X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0s libXt is based).  It wasnt documented and was  removed in X11R5 (MITs guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface).    A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4 or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.

You should consult your system administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security  problems at your site. 	2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic). 	3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths to the libraries.  [from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]  The R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this  may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks.  Xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits  anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by  accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console  display.

Although it is not  specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the  configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable. 	Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not  obvious.

Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will  only run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many  vendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case  they will display rectangular windows anyway.  	In order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library  libXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes will be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do  notcompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X  libraries.  [from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- When I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the  error "" 	What you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to  get Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you cant share a function that  is both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting  _XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby  guaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where  XtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally be called.  	You are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal Xt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere.  	1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a  connection to the X server.  [OSF/Motifs 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called XtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your  program; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in. 	2) alternatively, your program doesnt need any Xt functions and is correct in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView  program. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command.   	It should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically, although this will certainly solve the problem. 	 [from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be);  11/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under  the current version of X, I get this	_XtScrollBarSetThumb 	_XtTextSetInsertionPoint 	_XtTextReplace  	There were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition to the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4 release notes.

[10/90]  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	The window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the window manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are called ""hints"" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you can use something like the         XWMHints wmhints;         ...         wmhints.flags = InputHint;         wmhints.input = True;         XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)  If your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput  resource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you dont have source, you can start up the application with the resource * Certain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having  this done.   	If you are using Suns OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that arent ICCCM-compliant. [mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	You cant reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case.  	For most cases, you shouldnt care which window manager is running, so  long as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in  which particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can  sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may  be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific *added* features (such as olwms push-pin menus) in order to give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window  managers functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing; this surely leads to future compatibility problems.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 	 	There is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the  Macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development  under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional  development. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive  application builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to ""test just  this one little thing"" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that  puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for quick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4  distributions, and the Xlib ""Hello World"" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and  R4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4  Xlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x   by Glenn Widener of Tektronix. 	[3/90]  	In addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute  showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display  connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	The XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like	{ 	Arg args[3]; 	int i; 	int sensitive;		/* oops; wrong data type */ 	i=0; 	XtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++; 	XtGetValues(widget, args, i ); 	... 	}  But XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte;  declaring the variable ""sensitive"" as Boolean works properly. This problem  comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types  Dimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar  problems if those types are actually short. Inuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widgets man page. [11/90]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	Youre probably trying to use these functions from application code. They should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a  parent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising  functions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use  only by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent. 	The only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources. Although this will result in the widget-internal functions being called, your application code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the  widgets data becoming corrupted. 	[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be  avoided; they shouldnt be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  	Although there are various details of the current implementation of the Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the ""new"" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves? What should happen to the widgets children? And by the time such semantics are defined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old  widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired  resources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in  creating a new widget.  	Note that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  David B.

Teams play in Wichita, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Memphis, Fort Worth, and Dallas.  Future expansion plans include Houston, San Antonio, Baton Rouge, Little Rock, El Paso, Albuquerque, Tuscon, and Amarillo.  Austin is a possibility if Dallas has to move.  Houston and San Antonio are in for this fall, with Baton Rouge and Little Rock likely for 94-95.------------------------------------------------------------------------------           Fort Worth Fire                 | Wichita Thunder                                           |Phone #:  (817) 335-FIRE                  | (316) 264-4625 SeasonSingle                                          | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------           Dallas Freeze                   | Tulsa Oilers                                           |Phone #:  (214) 421-PUCK                  | (918) 663-5888  ------------------ SeasonSingleAnnouncers-Bruce LeVine                   | Jeff Brucculeri            Mark Stone                     | Jeff Bowen ------------------------------------------------------------------------------           Memphis River Kings             | Oklahoma City Blazers                                           |Phone #:  (901) 278-9009                  | (405) 235-PUCK SeasonSingleAnnouncers-Dave Woloshin                  | John Brooks            Tom Stocker                    | Brian Barnhart ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  92-93 regular season standings                              W  L OTL PTS   GF   GA   PIM  AVG ATTDNCE (% cap) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Oklahoma City Blazers.... 39 18  3   81  291  232  1561  7,827   64.2 % Tulsa Ice Oilers......... 35 22  3   73  270  230  1430  5,547   81.0 % Dallas Freeze............ 31 25  4   66  276  242  1604  4,427   59.0 % Memphis RiverKings....... 26 27  7   59  253  272  1670  5,590   59.6 % Fort Worth Fire.......... 24 29  7   55  252  288  1747  4,920   43.7 % Wichita Thunder.......... 25 33  2   52  242  320  1876  4,474   46.2 %           Oklahoma City defeated Memphis, 4 games to 2 (WWLLWW)  Levin Trophy Playoff Team vs.--------------------                 Dallas  Fort Worth  Memphis  Oklahoma City  Tulsa  Wichita Dallas.......... -----     9-2-1     5-5-2       5-6-1      5-7-0   7-5-0 Fort Worth...... 3-7-2     -----     4-6-2       4-8-0      8-3-1   5-5-2 Memphis......... 7-4-1     8-3-1     -----       2-8-2      2-8-2   7-4-1 Oklahoma City... 7-4-1     8-3-1    10-2-0       -----      6-6-0   8-3-1 Tulsa........... 7-5-0     4-7-1    10-2-0       6-6-0      -----   8-2-2 Wichita......... 5-7-0     7-3-2     5-7-0       4-8-0      4-8-0   -----         Power Play Statistics               Penalty Killng Statistics              PPG  Opp  ShGA   Pct.

But only in NY,NJ, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Everywhere else, the only reason SportsChannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts. And local baseball pre-empted the NHL playoffs. Thus far into this playoff season, ESPN/ABC has given me more hockey in 2 days (1 game) than SportsChannel did (0 games).  If people want hockey on TV, they should watch hockey on TV. I bet the ratings for hockey on Sunday on ABC went into the toilet. Next week, there will be far fewer ABC affiliates with hockey.

" Im writing an X server for some video-generation equipment.  The hardware is ""truecolor"" in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bit static color visual.  I would really like to have the server just present this static visual, but Im not sure if this will be  acceptable to ""most"" X clients.  The three problems I see   1) The colormap, though huge, is static.   2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.   3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the      translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.  Being more of a server guy than a client guy, Ilimitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff floating around blithely accept what theyre given?  I could write the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits,  but Id rather avoid this if not necessary.  I know there are no absolutes, but Id appreciate hearing peoples opinions and suggestions.  Thanks!  --  Frederick G. M. Roeber | CERN -- European Center for Nuclear Research",2,comp.windows.x

This meant that >it would crash on the Moon eventually, since there is no such thing as >a stable lunar orbit (as far as anyone knows), and I believe I recall >hearing recently that it was about to happen.   The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit fuzzy regions.  These are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down. The idea is that natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel, well just find the trajectory that makes it possible"". The originator of the technique said that NASA wasnt interested, but that Japan was because their probe was small and couldnt hold a lot of fuel for deceleration.

Otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial Unix.   An important factor in the Linux community is that source code is always   available (this is probably similar in the 386BSD community, however, Im not   really involved there). Many people using Linux like to stay at the cutting   (bleeding)  out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. The prime requirement for   all Linux software is that it is available under a GNU style public license.   Hence, Linux software uses either the Athena widgets or XView.   Individuals may write software requiring Motif, but I doubt it is widely   adopted.  				Regards,  					Richard Gooch.... ",2,comp.windows.x
" MIGHTY ONES GET TPS, the Finnish Champions 1992/3, are getting still stronger!  I just heard some news, according to which TPS has acquired the next Finnish hockey superstar(??) Jere Lehtinen from Kiekko-Espoo!  There are also some rumours about Erik Kakko (Reipas) and Marko Jantunen (KalPa) being traded to TPS. Both of this players are currently on the Finnish olympic team. I think that Jantunen is drafted to the NHL, too.  BTW. Is Juha Yl|nen (centre, HPK) drafted by the Jets?? During last year he has reached the top level among Finnish centres. He had very good playoff games against TPS!

"   Hi Xperts!    I have a Sparc-1 with very limited disk space on /usr partition.    previously, i was able to run all x-windows applications  and then     i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. My immediate alternative was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. This resulted in not loading openwindows. As a result of which none of the X-libraries got loaded.     I am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin/X11 files  required for running X-windows and compiling my programs written for Xlib and Xaw. In a desperate effort to regain x-windows, i retrieved /usr/lib/libX*.* files from the tape . /usr/bin/X11/*  and /usr/include/X11/* . Is this enough for running X-windows    BUt i did not get /usr/lib/X11/fonts/  sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi, 75dpi  and misc.   when i run xinit, the error message says /usr/lib/X11/fonts/100dpi etc are not in the default path. But the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no disk space.  Are there any temporary suggestions before I get a 1.5 GB disk and load openwindows , to just have my x-windows running.   Thanks  Pramod   --  ",2,comp.windows.x

"   Anna Matyas (am2x+@andrew.cmu.edu)> Wasnt Ron Francis captain of the Whalers when he was traded to > Pittsburgh?  No.  In what still, IMHO, ranks as the all-time greatest PR blunder (not to mention on-ice blunder) the Whalers ever committed, GM Eddie Johnston and Coach Rick Ley decided that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped him of the Captains ""C"" in December of 1990. The whole organization (EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly  humiliating him, stripping him of the ""C"", and then trading him that Spring to the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.  The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.  [Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it acquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the roster but he DID lay a foundation.]  -SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder) -steveg@cadkey.com ",0,rec.sport.hockey
"     Press Release No.19-93 Paris, 22 April 1993  Users of ESAs Olympus satellite report on the outcome of their experiments  ""Today Europes space telecommunications sector would not be blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s"". This summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).  OLYMPUS has been particularly useful : -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of        new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small        antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested        data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,        distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few        examples.  -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services        which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-        frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over        Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.  -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS        received for the first time in Europe, over several months,        high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and        then distributed it to various centres in Europe.  When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the worlds largest telecommunications satellite; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.  OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some of the worlds largest businesses. Access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning organisation.    As the new technologies and services tested by these OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then make use of operational satellites such as those of EUTELSAT.  OLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994, when the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the end of its design life.          ",1,sci.space

PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for  many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size  and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,  bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)  may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different  line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of  distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in  the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek  alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts  can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device  drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile  format and renderer.   The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain.  The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly  granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without  consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT  object library and header files in a commercial package provided is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely  available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed  somewhere in the documentation for the package.   We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of  user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any  published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work,  which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that  as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the  kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest  in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only  afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on  those which help us get our work done.   PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically  without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub  routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any  modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the  header file ""plplot.h""; see the documentation for more details.   The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of  several TeX files; please consult this for additional information (latex  plotdoc).  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to  the code, so dont be surprised if some known features are not explained  there.  Consult Changes.log to see a list of recent changes.     At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following		 A/IX  		 HP-UX 		 Unicos 		 DG/UX 		 Ultrix 		 SysV 		 Linux  	 Amiga/Exec 	 MS-DOS 	 OS/2 	 NeXT   For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system,  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual   - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory.

Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However, the concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I  suspect.  Im not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic  benefit from Lindberghs flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a human powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic benefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the  equivalent amount of direct investment would.

" I was planning to use the following pipe to move some display data to a system that has a color hardcopy 	xwd | xwud -display I had tested it with some simple windows like the OpenWindows file manager, and it worked fine, but when I tried it with a more complex (larger) image, the xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault.  I tried it without the pipe, by redirecting xwds output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud and got the same error from xwud.  If I had to guess, it seems like its running out of memory, but this happened on a SPARC 10 with 64 megs, 128 meg swap space, and only one user with minimal activity.  The file was about 3 MB.

First, I create the shared memory segment, attach the client,   attach the X server, and then remove (!) the segment. If you read the man   pages on removing of shared memory segments, you will see that the segment   only dies after all attachments are gone.   Now, if the client dies, thats one attachment gone (the OS cleans up for you)   and since the X server notices the client has dies, frees up its resources,   including detaching from the  shared memory segment.

"   SOmebody mentioned  a re-boost of HST during this mission,  meaning that Weight is a very tight  margin on this  mission.  How will said re-boost be done?  Grapple, HST,  stow it in Cargo bay,  do OMS burn to high altitude,    unstow  HST,   repair  gyros,  costar install,  fix solar arrays,  then return to earth?  My guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost?  why not  grapple,  do all said fixes,   bolt a small  liquid  fueled thruster module  to  HST,   then let it make the re-boost.  it has to be cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug.   that way, now that they are going to need at least 5  spacewalks,  then they can carry an EDO pallet,  and  sit on station and even  maybe do the  solar array tilt  motor  fix.  pat ",1,sci.space

A low GAA against good > teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context > of comparing two goaltenders.  Lets start over.  Im not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  Id take Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1 netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records are similar.  And with that, I just dont see how you can label Roussel as the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.  You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well be, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in those games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh, the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.  > The same > for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a > great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If > you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.  But Im not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  Ive seen him play for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  Its just my opinion, but I think hes got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that about Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So Im batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.  As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the save.  If he didnt, it wouldnt have mattered if the Rangers player didnt get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway thats what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the shooter to beat him.  > But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie > stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel > doesnt have a game like that in him.  I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you cant tell me that a Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are part of the game.  Or thered never be shutouts.  Anyway, Im happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and Im not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current 7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I dont want to piss you off to the point that you dont sell me any tickets next                                          \ \ Joe Dakes                                 \/\ AT&T Microelectronics                      \/\ 555 Union Boulevard                         \ \ Allentown, PA  18103                     LETS GO FLYERS!  alux1!jmd                                     \ \ jmd@aluxpo.att.com                             \ \__________                                                 \____/_//__/  ",0,rec.sport.hockey

" PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS      This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes     (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew     Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on     Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material     posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS       MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed     minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground     stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the     onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in     the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the     Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed     to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a     transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted     from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative     of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations     of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.      MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December     of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a     very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world     with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide     (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).      MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective     shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary     space. Unable to collect the Suns energy for power from its solar     panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in     solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.      MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and     took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it     flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere     much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from     this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the     geological and biological sense.      MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that     planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information     that Venus atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times     that of Earths, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface     of an ocean.      MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work     done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away     the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic     measurements of MARINER 4.      MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket     launcher autopilot failed.      MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to     orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no     other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian     surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once     flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup     images of Mars two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.      MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe     did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in     ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,     plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four     Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974     to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed     Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than     thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which     makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.       PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)      PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph     the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide     new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new     data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft     had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on     October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.      PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first     U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally     designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead     studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to     36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6     through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would     have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.      PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER     11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to     study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through     1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever     to do so.      PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER     12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made     the first radar studies of the planets surface via probe. PIONEER Venus     2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere     in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the     atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the     surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day     probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before     its batteries failed.       RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)      RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They     were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems     left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.      RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an     instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the     launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.     RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the     camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.      RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but     suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,     the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.      RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost     all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon     and drifted off into solar orbit.      RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact     with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras     did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first     U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.       LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)      LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image     various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO     missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our     understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.     All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were     essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.     probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar     surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.       SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)      The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar     module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the     soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered     in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing     vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was     strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.      Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the     first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images     and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from     SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,     the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored     the Tycho crater region in 1968.       VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)      VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on     a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June     19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse     Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for     Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes     found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of     its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars sky was     pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is     pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the     thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and     boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.      The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran     out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a     weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep     functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command     had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until     further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the     engineers efforts through May of 1983.      An interesting side    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the     lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,     D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until     it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.      VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit     on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in     Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its     sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording     one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in     1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut     down on April 12, 1980.      The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.       VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)      VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March     5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched     August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,     1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and     by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare     once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to     outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,     but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.      Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their     satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered     that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and     aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major     surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous     volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.      When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets     and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep     the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle     is known). Titans atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas appearance was    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,     kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.      VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,     continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly     monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was     found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational     axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on     Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10     satellites and one more ring were discovered.      In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,     including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright     patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were     discovered. Neptunes magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a     canteloupe appearance and geysers. (Whats liquid at 38K?)      The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their     on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets     beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the     location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS      Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and     Mars, I will highlight only the primary      SOVIET LUNAR PROBES      LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first 	     craft in solar orbit.     LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.     LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.     ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was 	     also a test for future Mars missions.     LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images 	     from surface.     LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.     LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.     ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8 	     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were 	     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.     LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil 	      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in 	      1972.     LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moons 	      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished 	      with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.     LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in 	      1976.       SOVIET VENUS PROBES      VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions 	       lost enroute in 1961.     VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with 	       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in 	       February of 1966. No images were returned.     VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface. 	       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe 	       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.     VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending 	       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before 	       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles 	       similar in 1969.     VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet 	       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in 	       1972.     VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the 	       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar 	       mission.     VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982. 		VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.     VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of 		planets surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.     VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian 	     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on 	     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in 	     March of 1986.       SOVIET MARS PROBES      MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased 	     enroute the following year.     ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian 	     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.     MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian 	     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red 	     Planet in 1971.     MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander 	     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.     MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to 	     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.     MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in 	     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S. 	     probe MARINER 9.     MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.     MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit 	     with its flyby bus.     PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars largest 	       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to 	       human/computer error.     PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did 	       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week 	       before scheduled Phobos landing.      While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even     interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have     yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,     Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a     Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been     planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now     the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their     space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS      SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on     January 8 1985, and approached Halleys Comet within about 7 million km     on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to     measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of     which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on     January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earths. The closest     approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The     geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for     a Japanese spacecraft.      During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail     passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby     will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earths radius)), and the third     October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).       HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,     1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten     once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first     lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget     satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to     orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.      The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An     apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists     to lose track of it. Hagoromos rocket motor fired on schedule on March     19, but the spacecrafts tracking transmitter failed immediately. The     rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt     camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.      Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and     performed aerobraking experiments using the Earths atmosphere. Hiten     made a close approach to the moon at    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moons surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and     fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into     lunar orbit.

This list is by no means     complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your     research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can     add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.      Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it     would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in     order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in     this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date     general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra     background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good     public and university library. Some of the more recently published works     can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market     bookstore.      General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):        J.

Other works and     NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space     probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry     these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission     you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study     some of the books listed above.      Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL     GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earths     Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,     SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER     missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the     VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.      More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions     can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and     SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major     newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,     but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events     were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are     affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you     probably know.      Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you     might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space     groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their     periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe     missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,     Pasadena, California 91106 USA.      Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I     personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas     in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from     it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

In fact, be- fore BATSE, having this widely separated ""Interplanetary Network"" was the only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot locate a burst (except to say ""Its somewhere in the field of view."").  With two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors, one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the  sky), voila, you have an error box.  BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination, but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde- pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.  You did touch on something that you didnt mean to, though.  Some believe (in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would be a mean, nasty God, though, that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gauss neutron star...but this is getting too far afield.  Peter peterf@oddjob.uchicago.edu  ",1,sci.space

" ForwardedPUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE JET PROPULSION LABORATORY CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION PASADENA, CALIF. 91109. (818) 354-5011 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506       Scientists at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earths ozone layer.       The April 3 flight from Californias Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).         The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.       ""We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways,"" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.         ""There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,"" he continued.  ""The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.""       The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring.  Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.       The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPLozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.        Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.       ""We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements,"" Margitan explained, ""and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.""       It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.           The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASAs Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.       The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.       The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASAs Upper Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements Program.                                                        #####      ___    _____     ___     /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps  /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation  |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation                                                   | instead.

Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run).  Thus we would have concentrated on the moon.   /~~~(| ""I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving	|  | the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the 	| | Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.""    		| |                  <John F.

 Does anyone know what is available in terms of automated testing of X/Motif applications. I am thinking of a system which I could program (or which could record events/output) with our verification test procedures and then run/rerun each time we do regression testing. I am interested in a product like this for our UNIX projects and for a separate project which will be using OpenVMS.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Mark D.

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions. However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a disk population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical halo population).  We dont see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.  >my own pet theory is that its  Flying saucers  entering >hyperspace :-)  The arent concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we dont see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.  >but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they >are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered >if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.  There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature. Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium on new models until new observational evidence comes in.  --  		David M.

"   From scott Fri Apr 23	id AA16121; Fri, 23 Apr 93 Redwood City, CA (API) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs.  Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free will, but Jobs persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.  In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the industry.  At times, he has claimed to ""have hardware which will blow anything else away"", while more recently he claims they have stopped manufacturing their own.  Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and possibly Canon equipment.  The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations, including a young man who will identify himself only as ""Bill"" and claims to be the ""MS-iah"".  Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work 20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of ""interpersonal computing"" which rejects traditional roles.  Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on federal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares throughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own apocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers carry Jobs own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling ""I want to welcome you to the Next World "".  - - --  Roland J.

I have a feeling   > this cant be fixed in emacs itself, but that I need to do some   > xmodmap stuff. Can someone help me?  Unfortunately, the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into emacs.  I ran into this problem a while back; my solution was to change the source code so that all of these special keys generated character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier state as escape sequences -- for example, the sequence ""ESC [ 1 B 7""  would indicate that the ""HOME"" key was pressed, with the shift key down.  You could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers, such as ""shift-Return"".  If anybody wants these changes, theyre welcome to them, but youll have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with it a bit.  Basically you have to replace the keypress handling code in the source file ""x11term.c"".  Maybe if someone at OSF is  interested, I can send them the tweaks, but I imagine theyve got bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about  emacs V19!).  If theres sufficient interest, Ill post the mods  somewhere, although this probably isnt the appropriate group for it.  * This special code will only apply if you let emacs create    its own (X11) window.  If you run it in plain old tty mode (which     includes Xterm windows) then its business as usual.   * The patches I made were to version 18.58, under Sun OS 4.1.2    [I also did this a while back under HP-UX].

If a player is on the ice when his team scores a lot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right. It is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the same team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally good players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare between players on different teams.  I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful are the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is a missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a better stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice time actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who doesnt recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that thinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than +/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.  +/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent. You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed is a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.

HonorableMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.  Biggestas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+ points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. HonorableCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23 and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing,  although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the right side.  Biggestpoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate, since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it). Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the  Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorableafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got to make a number of starts in a row.  -SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder) -steveg@cadkey.com ",0,rec.sport.hockey
"  Has anyone found a fix for the following problem?  ClientServerServer A Motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the OpenWindows 3.0 server (xnews). The pulldown is displayed but then no button actions have any effect. Sometimes pressing <Return> will unstick the application but not usually. It looks like the pulldown is grabbing the focus and never letting go. Other windows on the display continue to get updated so the server isnt hanging. If I log in from another terminal and kill the Motif application then everything gets back to normal. The same application when run against other X servers (including MIT X11R5 Xsun, DecWindows, Tektronix X terminal) has no problems. This is obviously a OpenWindows problem but I need a work-around since most of our customers are OpenWindows users.  I have tried the following     1. Installing the latest version of the OpenWindows server patch        (100444-37).      2. Using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.      3. Applying the patch specified in the Motif FAQ (question 110).        This had the effect of disabling the point-and-click method of        menu interaction (as opposed to the click-and-drag method), and        screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. It did seem to help, but I        was still able to get the application to hang.  Repeat This is an intermittent problem so youll have to try several times.  Click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)  Click and release on a menu item  Repeat until application hangs   Any help would be appreciated.

" TSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported that Montreal will send 4 players + $15 million including Vin Damphousse  and Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia, Phillie will send Eric Lindros to Ottawa, and Ottawa will give its first round pick to Montreal.   If this is true, it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawa gets to choose 1st overall.  Can Ottawa afford Lindros salary?   Personally, I cant see Philli giving up Lindros -- for anything.   They didnt give away that much to Quebec just to trade him away  again.  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a *huge* draw in Phillie -- and that he represents a successful future for the  franchise.   Ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players +$15 from Montreal for the pick.   Stephen Legge SLEGGE@kean.ucs.munc.ca  ",0,rec.sport.hockey

"  If youre willing to do a little work, you can make DrawnButtons do what you want, more-or-less. One of my colleagues here at GE CRD has done just that in our internal LYMB system.  We have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of dial positions from a single set of vectors. Each set of vectors is then drawn into a pixmap. Clicking the button advances the knobs state and changes to the next pixmap in the sequence.  Using DrawnButtons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular portion of the parent widget, but thats normally not a big shortcoming.

" From the ""JPL Universe"" April 23, 1993  SIRTF is still very much in business  By Mark Whalen      In these times of extra-tight NASA budgets, the very survival of a number of missions has been uncertain. But thanks to major design refinements implemented in recent months, JPLs Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -- a major project considered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is ""alive and well,"" according to Project Scientist Michael Werner.      A lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission have added up to a less expensive project with ""tremendous scientific power"" and a bright future, said Werner.      Designed as a follow-up to the highly successful Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) missions, SIRTF -- a cryogenically cooled observatory for infrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000 or 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.      IRAS pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10 years ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as never before and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25 comets. It provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive than any previously available from ground-based observations. COBE has measured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large angular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.      But to illuminate SIRTFs potential, Jim Evans, JPLs manager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects, recently said that the project is ""1,000 to 1 million times more capable than IRAS,"" based on technological advances in infrared detector arrays.      However, despite the enormous strides in infrared exploration SIRTF promised, and the fact that it was cited as the highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s (by the National Academy of Sciences), it took a ""diet or die"" directive from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the project going, according to Werner.      The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF, based on the key factor in its newinstead of the Earth, permitting the use of an Atlas rocket launch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan. ""The main advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your launch capability for boosting the payload -- you dont have to carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit,"" Werner said. The other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that ""its in a better thermal environment, away from the heat of the Earth.""      Additional major changes in SIRTFs redesign include shortening the mission from five to three years and building a spacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original plan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds) compared to Titan SIRTFs 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).      All of that adds up to ""a less stressful launch environment,"" Werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200 million for the launch, in addition to increased savings in the design of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.      Werner said SIRTFs redesign came as a result of Congress telling NASA ""youre trying to do too many things. If you want us to support SIRTF, which is a good project, develop a plan to see how it fits into (NASAs) overall strategy.""      Shortly thereafter, SIRTF was named as NASAs highest priority ""flagship"" scientific mission by the interdisciplinary Space Sciences Advisory Committee, in addition to the blessing from the National Academy of Sciences.      While the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping to keep the project alive, SIRTFs major scientific contribution always promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector arrays, which will allow images to be developed ""tens of thousands of times faster"" than before, according to Evans.      ""Up until a couple of years ago,"" Werner said, ""all infrared astronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays of individually assembled detectors. Since then, the Department of Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or hundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, and those are very well suited for use on SIRTF.""      Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget pressures, Congress is currently watching NASA projects with an eye out for any ""technological spinoff.""      ""On that question, I think we have some things to say,"" he said, ""because the detectors were using are straight off various military developments. Also, SIRTF will be built by the U.S. aerospace industry, and its a real technological and engineering challenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.      ""SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community,"" Werner added, but the revised three-year mission ""puts a premium on observing time. We have to educate the user community and develop a program that involves early surveys and quick turnaround of the data.""      Werner said the downsizing of the project required a reduction in scope and complexity of SIRTFs three instruments -- the infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multiband imaging photometer. However, these reductions will only result in losses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.      The project hopes to start a ""Phase B"" activity in 1995, which will provide a detailed concept for development and design. Building the hardware would begin about two years later.      Projected cost estimates, Evans said, are $850 million-$950 million.      ""I am very optimistic about SIRTF,"" he said. ""It will provide a tremendous return for the investment.""      Werner added that an additional benefit from the project will be the ""enrichment of our intellectual and cultural environment. People on the street are very interested in astronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on other planets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind of questions SIRTF will help answer.""                               ###      ___    _____     ___     /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

All conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting, though only Consortium members will be able to vote.  This years theme is   	Application Construction by Non-Programmers  Much of the effort on X toolkits has been aimed at programmer construction of applications.  There have, however, been some excellent UIMS systems built on top of X.  Papers addressing the theme will consider questions such as 	What is needed for application construction by non-programmers? 	Can we avoid programming altogether, or is a simple language needed? 	Is it sufficient to create applications, or must users be able to create new widgets? 	Should widgets and applications be able to print themselves?  Your participation in the conference is welcome.  Papers are appropriate on the theme or any aspect of the Andrew User Interface System, including  	applications 	experience with users 	new objects 	reviews of and proposals for revision of  		internal Andrew protocols  We expect to have an RS/6000 with video projector available if you would like to do a demonstration.    Paper proposals should be submitted by 15 May 1993. Acceptance will be 1 June with final papers due by 15 June.  Send papers via electronic mail to wjh+@andrew.cmu.edu.

Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his was a ""jingoistic rant"", but you also supported the name-changing on the grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals they represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I  think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an  observation...  However, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for the casual fan), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names based on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice and unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of people that are interested in hockey, so its a pointless exercise anyway.  If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not  central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is whether or not players like Orr who contributed to the glory of the sport would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to play in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although it was the chicken.....)  >Exactly true.

However, Id suggest Kelly Buchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for the All-Star game notwithstanding.  As for biggest surprise, Id say that Buchberger had higher expectations this year due to his ""breakthrough"" year (for him) last year, so he didnt really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.

"     Joint Press release ESA/UN No 18-93 Paris, 19 April 1993  UN/ESA joint training course on satellite applications to be held in Italy, 19-30 April  The United Nations and the European Space Agency (ESA) are jointly organising a training course on the applications of satellite data gathered by the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1), to be held in Frascati, Italy, from 19 to 30 April. The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agencys establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESAs remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.  A similar training course is being planned for Latin American experts.   ",1,sci.space

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD     On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National  Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held atCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.     Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.     Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.     For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.     The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earths ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.     OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you dont want to see the FAQ, add Frequently Asked Questions to your KILL file for this group (if youre not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, youre out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic     1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you arent surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.

" SSF is up for redesign again.  Lets do it right this time!  Lets step back and consider the functionality we [1] microgravity/vacuum process research [2] life sciences research (adaptation to space) [3] spacecraft maintenence   The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet their targets by a widetook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to  tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial  users have come up with a superior strategy for spaceconstellation.    Firstly, different functions are broken down into different  constellations placed in the optimal orbit for eachthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.  SSFs 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization.  [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellationCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is inexpensive, incrementalon Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. We might also expand the research program to take advantage of  interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt  or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a  station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.  [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface, testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts.  [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in  Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.  By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSFs pricetag, we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study lifes adaptation to a much large & more representative variety  of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose orbits.  N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.   Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously  we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSats technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost.   --  Nick Szabo					 szabo@techboook.com ",1,sci.space

" We recently got an NCD X-terminal to evaluate. This is running XRemote over a serial line. I wanted to get some measurement of response time, so I wrote a small Xlib program which simply creates a window, maps it and sends the first Expose  event to itself. The program times the delay from sending the event, to  receiving it.  I thought this was the simplest way to test client/X-server  round-trip delays. Its a similar concept to the ping(8C) program.  Is this a valid test to perform ? Ive also tried the xbench program, available from ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but I  just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is ""acceptable"" interactive  response time.

Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  Ive never >heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?  SEI Level 5 (the highest level -- the SEI stands for Software Engineering Institute).  Im not sure, but I believe that this rating only applies to the flight software.  Also keep in mind that it was *not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather through a brute force and ignorance attack on the problem during the Challenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and did the whole process by hand.  I would not consider receiving a Warning status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if anything) from such a rating -- Ill have to get the latest copy of the guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think).  Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with control of the software process; the assumption is that a well controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mind that SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.  Most software in this country is produced by engineering practicies that only rate an SEI Level 1 (if that).   --  ""Insisting on perfect safety is for people who dont have the balls to live  in the real world.""   -- Mary Shafer, NASA Ames Dryden ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Fred.McCall@dseg.ti.com - I dont speak for others and they dont speak for me.

These maps were produced by the Microwave Limb Sounder aboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), and are courtesy of the Public Information Office at JPL.  Note that the images are in GIF89a format, so make sure your display software supports this format (as opposed to the older GIF87a format).  The caption files accompanying the images are appended at the end of this message, as well as being embedded in the images.  The images are available by dialup modem at +1 (818) 354-1333, up to 9600 bps, parameters N-8-1, or by using anonymous ftp                  ozone93b.gif - Southern hemisphere       Also, photographic prints of these images can be ordered from Newell Color Lab listed below.

" Well, the tentative rules, anyway.  And, of course, since the season is not entirely over, tentative entry form.  But who cares?  The real hockey season is starting!!!!!  Heres thenumber of games you think each series will go.  Each round will be weighted, so that the Stanley Cup finals will be very important, but the early rounds will still be important.  Here is the Pick 1st round winner, way off onPick 1st round winner, within onePick 1st round winner, pick # of Pick 2nd round winner, way off onPick 2nd round winner, within onePick 2nd round winner, pick # of Pick conference champ, way off onPick conference champ, within onePick conference champ, pick # of Pick Stanley Cup champ, way off onPick Stanley Cup champ, within onePick Stanley Cup champ, pick # ofPick loser in 7, series goesPick loser in 7, series decided in Game 7,(these last two are sympathy points, probably wont happen anyway)  Obviously, picking the Stanley Cup champion is important.  I will do some tests to see if the format is fair, but probably I will be too lazy to modify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.

" Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinking wishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball.  The league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe. (for those that dont know, the best teams from lower divisions get promoted and the worst get demoted).  Would European fans put up with our ""if youve paid, you can play""  attitude??  How long would they support teams that are run on Ranger-based  corporate thinking (I use the term lightly).  (We dont need a good product because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawas record every year......1940!! haha (sorry, had ta say it)).  If hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to Europe, maybe teams like the Rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth  division).  Wed have many more teams...centres that arent as big (like Halifax or Adirondack....ok, so Halifax isnt a good example) would  eventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive within its own division (unlike Ottawa, SJ, Edmonton, etc.). Fans would eventually get rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and the league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx of newly promoted teams (and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley Cup...I can dream, cant I??)  Look at British (or any European) soccer as an example (they never have fan problems).

Theres : presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldnt be superstars at : the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be : that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.  Wow, now, it looks like you dont like our players? What about guysNieminen, Jutila, Riihijarvi, Varvio, Laukkanen, Makela, Keskinen and (even if he is aging) Ruotsalainen? The main difference between finnish and North- American players is, that our players tend to be better in the larger rink. The Canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in Europe.  And I think that there was more in our success than Ketterer and luck (though they helped). I think that the main reason was, that the team worked well together. -- *********************************************************************** * Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle howl*  *  howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp uuuurgh  * *                                       -Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz       * *********************************************************************** 	-Marko Poutiainen 	 mep@phoenix.oulu.fi ",0,rec.sport.hockey

He is taking college courses now, I presume he is studying hard, and his postings reveal that he is *somewhat* hip to the technical issues of astronautics.

Worden,                      The Deputy for Technology, SDIO                                                        Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach                               April 3,1993       Most of you, as am I, are ""children of the 1960s.""  We grew up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were miracles of our parents doing.  For a decade and more the pundits have told us - ""youve lost it!""  The ""me"" generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past.       You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as General Bernie Schriever told of his teams work - and yes struggle - to build this nations Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.       What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen. Schrievers ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missiles.       Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing.  This event is proof.  To our technologicalto your stories.  Weve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit.  And weve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated into todays most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.       You told us in the 60s that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920s and 30s - build a little and test a little and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who started this program for the SDI.       Douglas Aircraft didnt start with a DC-10.  They didnt even start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step.  They didnt take a decade or more before putting the first ""rubber on the road.""  Max Hunter - you didnt take ten years to build Thor, and by God were not going to take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable aerospace transportation is real.       We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us - launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship.       But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.       We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And yes - well make a little money off it too!       Then - and only then - well spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries.  What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to counter SDI merge to power mankinds next step to the stars!       To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer.  Robert Goddards first rockets werent Saturn Vs!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at hand!       This project is real.  The torch of American technological greatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is American.  Lets go fly it! ",1,sci.space

ANSICCOPTIONS  This article does NOT include answers to general X questions, since these are already covered by the X FAQ that is regularly posted by David B. Lewis <faq%craft@uunet.uu.net>.  If you have anything to add or change on the FAQ just let me know. (especially if you had a problem that someone else was able to help you with) Send changes to steve@ecf.toronto.edu, please put FAQ somewhere in the subject line so that my mail filter will put it in the correct mail folder.  Please DO NOT ask me questions that are not answered in the FAQ.  I do not have time to respond to these individually.  Instead, post your question to the net, and send me the question and answer together when you get it.  Frequently Asked Questions About X on Intel-based Unix (with answers) =====================================================================  I) What options do I have for X software on my Intel-based Unix system?  1. Free options 	The BEST option is XFree86, which is an enhanced version of X386 1.2. 	Any other version of X386 will have slower performance, and will 	be more difficult to compile.  Information on how to obtain XFree86 	is listed below.  	X386 is the port of the X11 server to System V/386 that was 	done by Thomas Roell (roell@sgcs.com). 	It supports a wide variety of SVGA boards. 	There are 2 major free	X386 1.2 is included in MITs X11R5 distribution (ie. you 	dont need to patch it into the MIT source any more). 	X386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from SGCS (see below).  2. Commercial options       1) Metro Link 	2213 W.

II) What is XFree86 and where do I get it?  3. What is XFree86?     XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with    X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and    other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the     1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,        selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require        an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of        1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by        default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield        up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.     2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default        operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now        equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately        20% faster than X386 1.2.     3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,        or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4        with the Advanced Compatibility Package, local connections from        SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.     4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.        Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about        the ATI and Trident drivers.     5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardts        code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).     6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is        compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the        contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.     7) New configuration method which allows the servers drivers and font        renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary        distributions.     8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.     9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA        cards is now included.     The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2    (they were not in XFree86 1.1):      1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of        available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200         (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).     2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the        monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a ""two        headed"" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only        been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).     3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.     4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to        consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for        more information.)     5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some         versions of these devices were not previously compatible).     6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor        timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous        documentation and a lot of experimentation).     7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including        implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many         vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more         information).     8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has        been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of        0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks        line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.     9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig        configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative        and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new        options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1)         manual page for more information on the format of this file).         Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file        in the source distribution for full details.     Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the    current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.  4. What OSs are supported?      XFree86	Linux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1  	BSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active 	BSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.  	Note that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet, 	but anyone should feel free to submit patches. 	If you are interested in tackling this, send mail to 	xfree86@physics.su.oz.au  5. What video hardware is supported?     At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA 	Tseng ET4000 	Tseng ET3000 	Paradise PVGA1 	Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of 		the PVGA1, and use its driver) 	Genoa GVGA 	Trident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000 	ATI 18800, 28800  	All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, 	with the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in 	256 color mode.  	The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of 	video memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the 	ET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome 	server, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.  	It appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to 	non-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To 	avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86 	1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel 	clock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are 	discovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how 	these programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such 	a program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with 	future XFree86 releases.  	If you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86, 	it is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the 	Orchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not 	work with them, because Diamond wont provide programming details. 	In fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond 	products, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions 	of code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities). 	If you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.  	Some people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA 	video cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the 	CPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It 	could be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset 	on the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers dont have a lot 	of access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested 	theory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not 	working on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86 	working fine on them.  6. What about accelerated boards?  	At this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards 	like the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available 	in commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).  	An S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact 	<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.  	A beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu> 	or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. 7. Why doesnt XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?  	The reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the 	16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory 	contains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit- 	planes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each 	of each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame- 	buffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled 	16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code 	could be modified to support this (or it already may; Im not sure). 	But for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer 	implementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this, 	but nothing is yet available from the project.  8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?  	Obviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run 	X efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum. 	The various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending 	on the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries). 	To build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will 	be required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable  	lower bound.  9. Where can I get source for XFree86?  	Source patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22 	from MIT), are available via anonymous FTP		export.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86) 		ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86) 		ftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86) 	(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)  	Refer to the README file under the specified directory for information 	on which files you need to get to build your distribution.  10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?  	Binaries are available via anonymous FTP		ftp.physics.su.oz.au		- SVR4 binaries 			under /XFree86/SVR4 		ftp.win.tue.nl			- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 		ferkel.ucsb.edu			- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/SVR4/XFree86 		stasi.bradley.edu		- SVR4 binaries 			under /pub/XFree86/SVR4 		blancmange.ma.utexas.edu	- SVR3 (ISC) binaries 			under /pub/ISC 		ftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries 			under /pub/pc/isc/XFree86 		tsx-11.mit.edu			- Linux binaries 			under /pub/linux/packages/X11 		agate.berkeley.edu		- 386BSD binaries 			under /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86 		ftp.cs.uwm.edu			- Mach binaries 			under /i386  	Ensure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may 	archive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will 	contain a README file that describes what files you need to take 	from the archive, and which compile-time option selections were 	made when building the distribution.  IV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?  11. Installation directories  	The top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot 	(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include 	files, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.  	This can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified 	via symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is 	nonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed 	alongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.  12. Configuration files  	The XFree86 server reads a configuration file (""Xconfig"") on startup. 	The search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in 	the server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.  13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes  	David E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known 	clock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings. 	The database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and 	is in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is 	also available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on 	export.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated 	occasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the 	settings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to 	David for inclusion in the database.  	If this doesnt help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file  	with XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings. 	It may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use 	this description to get them right.  When you do, send the information 	to David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.	      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot 	      clock values for a new board, remove the Clocks line from 	      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The 	      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out. 	      You can use these values to put a Clocks line into your 	      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up 	      starting the server in the future.  14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit  	If you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to 	reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is 	fully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.  V) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?  	First of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).  15. SVR4 	Why wont my xterm run properly?  	If your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define 	CONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm wont run. 	csh users should use setenv CONSEM no  	The Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping 	problems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be 	installed.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.  16. SVR3  	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if thats what you are running.  17. 386BSD  	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.  	Also, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey 	<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the 	file XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp 18. Linux  	You must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc 	jump libraries installed.  	Make sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.  	If your kernel doesnt have TCP support compiled in, youll have to 	run the server as ""X -pn"". The default startup configuration assumes 	that TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files 	/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the 	-pn argument to X386.  	Make sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major 	number 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not 	owned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit 	console output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but 	startx wont.  	When running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with 	a tty, for example ""xdm < /dev/console &"".  	For more detailed information, please read the file README present 	with the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.  19. Mach  	Make sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.  VI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?  	This section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is 	fully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs. 	Please look at those files for information on building XFree86.  VII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?  20. BSD compatibility library  	A lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc. 	The default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a 	which contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(), 	seed(). A better way of providing the b functions is to include 	<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro 	definitions for these in terms of the SYSV mem functions.  If you are 	linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these 	functions, then you should link with libXbsd.a  21. ANSICCOPTIONS  	This is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the 	ANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite 	the entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, youd see 	something like 		CCOPTIONS=""-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings"" 	and to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put 		CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings"" 	in his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of 		ANSICCOPTIONS=""-ansi"" 		CCOPTIONS=""-O2 -fwritable-strings"" 	and all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile		ANSICCOPTIONS= 	to get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death 	with -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because 	CCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must 	add ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS) to a PassCDebugFlags definition.

" Dear Xperts,  Im developing an application that uses a Motif slider to select an image file out of a directory. Now I would like to display the name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale button (i.e. with the MB1 pressed). As XmNshowValue only displays the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding image file name, I thought of using an XtAddEventHandler to do the mapping between the scale value and the file XtAddEventHandler(scaleImage,Button1MotionMask,  FALSE, SliderMoved, NULL);   and in the eventhandler do   while (XCheckTypedWindowEvent (display, event->window, MotionNotify, &Return))    ;   XmScaleGetValue(scaleImage,&value);   /*map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open*/   However, when I move the pointer in the scale widget I get callbacks, with of co    urse a null effect as my MB1 is not pressed to move the scale button.

NCD also sells a software-only package that provides XRemote (which is NCDs implementation of serial X11) for PCs.  There may be other such  software packages available.  X11R6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running X11 over low-speed connections.  Its called Low Bandwidth X (LBX), and  is based on improved versions of the techniques used in NCDs XRemote.

Some of what I  would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may  never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred -  unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars  as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and  a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time  - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man.  Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.   Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there  and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief  in an afterlife.    The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks  and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light  crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people  is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating  the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or  thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.   But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.   Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live  in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport  currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The  impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists  that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped  into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life  forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels  (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains  one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing,  malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed  the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80  miles to the east.  (Their security light didnt help matters  much either.)  But Ive heard the artic wilderness gets lots of  high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.   But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasnt  fouled in some way.  (I mean theyve been TRYING this forever -  like, concerning Teslas idea to banish night, - wow!)  I dont watch  commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer,  truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.   If ya gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at  least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.    To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage  of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday atlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  Ill be trying to see it  if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could  be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky  while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that  as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid,  even if it cant ever be perfectly achieved.   Regards,  Wm. Hathaway  Baltimore MD  ",1,sci.space

I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real- istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is  bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect  examples of players that real fans know arent worth a damn and yet, being benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to attract, that these players are indeed superstars.  >>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is  >>true.

But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners, but hadnt had to give in to it much yet.)  Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure. As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.  As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.

Most of the C preprocessors that 	I have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the 	line.  Thus the C preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the 	start of a directive.

The pressure  stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make  a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.   The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the  cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be  done there........   |>  |> They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads  |> (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course |> any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the |> US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political |> problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention.   The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it  lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I dont know what the proton uses  for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBMs I would suspect that they  use storable propellants which dont have the ullage problem that cryos  do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems  could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with  providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill  this idea.   --  H.D. Stevens Stanford UniversityAerospace Robotics LaboratoryDurand Building					(415) 722-3296  (Bullpen) Stanford, CA 94305",1,sci.space
"   I am working on a project to provide an emergency management information system.  In keeping with more classic command and control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor system in order to provide a status board on its own monitor.   I have a number of X level questions regarding (We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be  predominantly Suns, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).  I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured such that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens, and not multiple X displays.   Given 	- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple 	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  Theres 	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between 	screens?  	- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate 	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there? 	What are they; who sells them...  	- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a 	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?  	- Is there any way for the application to transparently see 	multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware 	only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?  	- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a 	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single 	screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate 	multiple screens instead)?   	I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely 	on providing config files which will specify for each 	configuration the screen placement of each window in the 	application.  Any thoughts or suggestions from past experience 	are more than welcome.   ======================================================================== Jo PelkeyBattelle Pacific Northwest LabsMail Stop K7-22P.O.

Boston Bruins   Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden  finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project  back on track to be finished in September 1995.   Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following  surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back. **   Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League.   Buffalo Sabres 1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)   Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike  Ramsey. **   Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the  clubs Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion  Sabres in 1970, was the teams play-by-play announcer on both television  and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season. **   Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of  American Hockey League.   Calgary Flames   Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future  considerations. **   Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt  Lake City of International Hockey League.   Chicago Blackhawks         The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to  open in August 1994, will be home to the NBAs Chicago Bulls and NHLs  Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two  teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the  old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility,  located directly across the street, opens.   Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report  following a trade with Edmonton.   Detroit Red Wings   Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft  pick.   Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in  the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft. **   Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall  of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze  plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site  of the Michigan Hall of Fame.   Edmonton Oilers   Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug  Weight.   Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers lease with  Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the  city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to  administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner  Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has  threatened to move the team if he doesnt get a better deal. He makes no  money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat  Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce  significant revenues for other owners.   Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the  remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.   Hartford Whalers   Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.   Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from  Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick. **   The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center  from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford  Whalers franchise in the city.   Los Angeles Kings   Sent center John McIntyre to the New York Rangers for defenseman Mark  Hardy and Ottawas fifth-round 1993 draft pick.   Minnesota North Stars 1-800-800-0435 if calling from the U.S. 1-800-800-0458 if calling from Canada   The Dallas City Council has approved an agreement with the Minnesota  North Stars that will bring the NHL club to Reunion Arena next season.   Defenseman Mark Tinordi, captain of the North Stars, will be sidelined  the rest of the season, including any postseason games the North Stars  might play, because of a broken collarbone.   Acquired defenseman Mark Osiecki from Winnipeg for ninth- and 10th-round  draft picks in 1993.   Added defenseman Travis Richards from the University of Minnesota.   A former employee filed a sexual harassment suit against Minnesota North  Star owner Norman Green. Karen (Kari) Dziedzic, Greens former executive  assistant, claims Green often instructed her to wear cosmetics, described  her outfits as ""very hot"" and ""very sexy,"" once slapped her hand as she  was about to eat and humiliated her by grabbing her hand and rubbing it  through a clients hair.   The Minnesota North Stars, who will move to Dallas after this season,  announced that nearly 11,000 season ticket reservations have been made for  their new home at Reunion Arena, which has a capacity of 16,800.   The Met Center commission has told the Minnesota North Stars that it  wants the club out - with its keys returned - at midnight after the last  home game.  The club is moving to Dallas for next season.  The club must  pay unpaid interest of $4,492.80 on the teams late rent payment for 1992,  which was made earlier this month, and has been instructed not to take  property such as the scoreboard and Zamboni ice-surfacing machine. **   Derian Hatchers game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the NHL,  allowing the Minnesota defenseman to play in the North Stars last two  regular-season games.  Hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at the  end of a loss at St. Louis on Sunday, April 11.  But the league didnt  rescind the game-misconduct penalty Shane Churla received.  The Stars  recalled center Cal McGowan from their top minor league club in Kalamazoo,  Mich., to replace Churla.   Montreal Canadiens   Acquired defenseman Rob Ramage from Tampa Bay for minor league  defensemen Eric Charron and Alain Cote and future considerations.   New Jersey Devils **   Bernie Nicholls publicly apologized for his criticism of referee Denis  Morel after the Devils 5-2 loss to the Buffalo Sabres.  Nicholls was  ejected by Morel for being the third man in on a fight late in the second  period of that game and afterward Nicholls called Morel ""a homer"" and ""an  embarrassment to the referees association.""   New York Islanders   Traded right wing Daniel Marois to Boston for a conditional draft  choice.   New York Rangers   Obtained forward Esa Tikkanen from Edmonton for center Doug Weight.   Acquired left winger Mike Hartman from Tampa Bay    Acquired center John McIntyre from Los Angeles for defenseman Mark Hardy  and Ottawas fifth-round 1993 draft pick.   Defenseman Brian Leetch will undergo additional surgery on the right  ankle he broke in a non-skating fall and is not expected to play again  this season.

Rheaume, the  first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six  goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10. After  the game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to  compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East  Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor  league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning. **   As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that  the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the  Minnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning  general manager Phil Esposito.  ESPN reported on Sunday, April 11, that  the Lightning, who have been playing in 10,400-seat Expo Hall, are  exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis.  But  Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  ""We were disappointed  with ESPNs irresponsible comment,"" Esposito said.  ""There is just no  substance to the rumor."" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years  regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to  build a new arena.

Disney and National Hockey League officials announced Monday,  March 1, that the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Disneys expansion team, will  take to the ice next fall. Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive  officer of the Walt Disney Co., said the Mighty Ducks will play at the  Pond, the new Anaheim sports arena, near Disneys flagship theme park. The  arena is under construction and will be completed in June. The Pond seats  17,350.

Western Conference teams will play six games against each of five  divisional opponents (30); four games against each of the six teams in the  conferences other division (24) and two games against each of the 14  Eastern Conference clubs (28).meeting the No. 8 team in the first round, No. 2 vs. No. 7, No. 3 vs. No.  6 and No. 4 vs. No. 5. Matchups will be based on overall points with the  four division champions being placed in the first- or second-place seeds  in each conference and being assured of home-ice in the first two playoff  rounds. All series will be best of seven (2-2-1-1-1 rotation) except  matchups between Central and Pacific teams.  Those series will rotate 2-3- 2 to reduce travel.  In those cases, the team with the most regular-season  points will choose whether to start the series at home or away.  -----  - Draft         Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in  June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one  goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion  drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction  between forwards and defensemen.         First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down  from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and  Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.         Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of  one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is  that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.         At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises  will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total  of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa  Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two  new teams.         Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority  drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst  records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The  expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose,  Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.         The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry  Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new  teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in  1994.          The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the  1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a  delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.  -----   - League   The NHL owners and players have resolved differences over salary  arbitration procedures, clearing the way for about 40 hearings.  NHLPA  executive director Bob Goodenow didnt disclose how the issues were  resolved, but the prior sticking point had been the manner in which  statistics were used in arbitration hearings.   The NHL announced February 26, 1993, it will not make professional  players available to compete in the 1994 Winter Olympics.  League         Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall succeeded Blackhawks owner  Bill Wirtz as chairman of the NHLs powerful Board of Governors. Appointed  to join McNall on the Executive Committee were Ron Corey of the Montreal  Canadiens, Mike Ilitch of the Detroit Red Wings, Peter Pocklington of the  Edmonton Oilers and Ed Snider of the Philadelphia Flyers.

Turner, former Prime  Minister of Canada, to serve on Board of Directors of Hockey Hall of Fame  and Museum and nominated Scotty Morrison, David M. Taylor, Larry Bertuzzi,  Robert G. Bundy, Walter Bush, Murray Costello, Jim Gregory, Leslie Kaplan,  Lawrence G. Meyer and Alan Tonks to serve on Board, which takes office  March 30.

" Aargh!  Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the NHL. He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques. The Nords penalty came in O.T.  Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself, was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!  It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous goalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau was serving a penalty.  I dont mind Stewart calling a penalty in the last 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords were caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.  Stewart turned the other cheek...BASTARD!  Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and on his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldnt have gone in.  Dont get me wrong, Im not blaming the loss on Stewart.  The Habs had plenty of chances to capitalize, Muller, LeClair, Haller, etc. but failed to put the puck in the net.  Thats what did them in.

"would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft. The idea was that youd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a ""pusher plate"" attached to the main spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship.    Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are going to hit thehelium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission products).    Would this work?  I cant see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems to me youre going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once theyre there.

"   I am sure  Mary or Henry can describe this more aptly then me. But here is how i understand it.  At Speed,  Near supersonic.  The wind behaves like a fluid pipe. It becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the wing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.  If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force compression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).  If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend into,  then drag is reduced.     Essentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf remain constant for all areas of the fuselage.

Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode (probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available, or you need to retrain a new team.  Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA  series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a ""standby"" mode for use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap.  Finally, Pats explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or  maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time.  In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money), but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.  David W. @ GSFC   ",1,sci.space

"   The mission to revive hockey at UMass is now underway. At the  4 PM Saturday afternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former Boston College Asst. Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000/year contract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen.   Mallen was the third viable pick for the position, right behind Jeff Jackson (Lake Superior) and second behind Shawn Walsh (UMaine). Previous offers for  the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of Brown, RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians.  UMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had undermined the teams position over a period of years. In late November of last year, the $52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following its one year construction deadline.   The Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II/Div III schedule this upcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994 season. Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or potential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will leverage off his inside contacts within New England, the Bay State and Europe to draw on competitive, top ice players for the University.  UMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ;  expect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources.  ....

" Hi,   Im trying to write a Motif program on an Interactive Unix machine, and Im observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a DrawingArea. Namely, some Xlib operations work, and some do not. In particular, the expose consist of two XFillRectangle calls followed by some XDrawPoint calls, and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the rightward direction over the drawing area, but after the move, is still on some part of the drawing area. This also happens less consistently when the pulldown/popup is moved in the leftward direction.  Assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd, is this a server bug?  Thanks,  Zack T.

" In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid rockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of  aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a foamed aluminum structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.

The second stage (L33) is built by MBB Erno and is powered by a single Viking IV engine.  Both the Viking IV and V engines are manufactured by SEP.  The first and second stages use a biliquid UH25/N2O4 fuel. The third stage (H10) is built by Aerospatiale, and is powered by a cryogenic H2/O2 fueled HM-7B engine built by SEP. The two strap-on boosters (PAL) are each powered by a Viking VI engine, also built  by SEP, which use the same biliquid fuel as the first and second stages.

"    Two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station.  While this ""Banner"" reflector was blank, NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial, as filmed from the Mir.    The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the ""Environmental Billboard"".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the ""Environmental Billboard"" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable frame.    To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ""ozone reading sensors"" to ""continuously monitor the condition of the Earths delicate protective ozone layer,"" according to Mike Lawson, head of SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earths atmosphere. According to IMI, ""as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer."" The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and ""adds to the ozone supply.""    This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising unit cost $600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.    But back to Brians>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN >news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the ""wild >idea"" stage or does it have real funding?        See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 M for a launch), then its probably real.  They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably cant piggy back upon someone elses planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch.  Thats a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.     And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I dont think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer, and no, I dont really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an idiot?)    (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if its in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since thats the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)     As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment.  I havent heard of any serious funding for this, but Im sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.       And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be my guest.  I dont have posting privileges to that area (or at least I dont THINK I do...).  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor  --- Maximus 2.01wb ",1,sci.space

From the description of ad here, it sounds like theyre talking about ""High Power Rocketry"", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.  Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and all of the launches are then covered under this ""blanket waiver"". There is also a ""High Power Safety Code"" which designates more specific rules such as launch field size, etc.  Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket  motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures require a demonstarted handling and ""safe"" flight at a total impulse level.  For more information, watch rec.models.rockets newsgroup.  R.

" From the ""JPL Universe"" April 23, 1993  Cosmologist Stephen Hawking tours Lab  By Karre Marino      Some 15 years after his first visit to JPL, Prof. Stephen Hawking, Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge University and author of ""A Brief History of Time,"" returned to the Lab April 5.      On a tour hosted by JPL Chief Scientist Dr. Moustafa Chahine and Merle McKenzie, manager of the International Affairs Office, Hawking visited a variety of facilities, met with Lab Director Dr. Edward Stone and various project scientists and managers, and felt ""like royalty,"" he said. Hawking, whose theories attempt to explain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate dimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, ""because while Im most interested in those things in space that are farther away, I know that here is where the first steps are taken.""      Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate students and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium, as David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of Flight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observers project scientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.      Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid to a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Should extraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted, they would find a variety of images that would explain something of Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating with the spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are.      Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutes describing the project and the spacecrafts features. In answer to a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposed drag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, ""its only a concept."" Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about five years before, described the professor as ""a living miracle of the power of the brain. Hes miraculous, and he has such a good sense of humor.""      The next stop, a demonstration on scientific data visualization in Section 384s Digital Image Animation Lab, entertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles to view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jong showed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been discovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious about its composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he asked several questions on their interpretation.      Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and Data Acquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations Facility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone.      The day ended with two technical discussions of particular interest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. Frank Estabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described a three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way. Then planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained the philosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.      The Hawking party, which had been visiting Southern California for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, and planned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab tour. Upon departing, the Cambridge-based scientist promised Chahine that he would return to JPL for another visit.                           ###      ___    _____     ___     /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

" After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as possible), Ive really noticed an increase in Tom Barassos cheap shots this year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other goaltenders).

He also KICKED John McLean. Of course he wasnt called for that. Isnt kicking an automatic match penalty and 10 game suspension?

"  	Well, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night.  The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles beat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.  	However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in general that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders  back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that  the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period, come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable how many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty  wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played  a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL  debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this  guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a  Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say its because the Isles dont shoot  correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this?  	Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick Vukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey talent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties.  Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And hes a defenseman.  Hes got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus.  This guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such ""enforcers""?  Not only do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are really trying to play the game.  Ill be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a  good fight once in a while, but only when its ""called for"".  You know, when a guy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of ""hockey ethics"" might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are losing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already.  Im sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the referee doesnt call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy, not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost.  If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to pull a guy down to prevent it, you dont deserve to win in the first place.

As you can see from file geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS) pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly.  The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Stations CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the docking system.  The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional launch mass.  Weve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but weve never had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember, it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.  The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Stations life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we dont kill any more kangaroos, like we did with Skylab).  The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.  This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical, data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work done to date.  Mark proposed this design at Joe Sheas committee in Crystal City, and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.  Please note that this text is my interpretation of Marks design; you should see his notes in the GIF files.    Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for anon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  Ill let you all know when I get that done.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office       kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368       ""...Development of the space station is as inevitable as        the rising of the sun."" -- Wernher von Braun ",1,sci.space

Heres how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that  black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars, M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time, they dont live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRBs) will be in the plane of the galaxy.           Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I suppose you are saying, ""Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk.""  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Heres anthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different, and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.           I should throw in why halo, and corona models dont work, also.  As I said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk, but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources  in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of these characteristics.                    I think thats all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knows something that I dont know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor of taking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these different distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible distribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars, black holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   Its a fun field.

" In article <C5wApJ.DD7@ibmpcug.co.uk> nicholas@ibmpcug.co.uk (Nicholas Young)    I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX    platform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source,    or can I make do with the public headers that are provided?    ""Motif"" includes Xt in this context.  Yes.  Youll find it almost impossible without the source at this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are and how concerned you are about compliance with the general interface and items like traversal.     One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have    already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be    a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.    Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?  Im not sure what youre asking.  You could create something which is very much like a true multi-column list by placing several lists within a geometry manager,  and putting that manager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldnt be good for very large lists,  but you might consider this as an alternative.     Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they    could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!    Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not    yet have the spec)?  Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have you looked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD  widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column list you could port.   -- Douglas S. Rand <drand@osf.org>		OSF/Motif Dev.Amateur",2,comp.windows.x

" I found this press release from Trial Lawyers for Public Justice on another system, and thought it would be of interest on campuses  where the administration or the athletics department wants to  eliminate the womens ice hockey team.   Women Athletes, TLP Win Sex DiscriminationOrdered to Restore Two Womens Varsity Teams          Ray Marcaccio, 401-831-8900, both of Trial Lawyers For           Public Justice     WASHINGTON, April 16 -- The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston has upheld a U.S. District Court order requiring Brown University to immediately reinstate its womens gymnastics and volleyball teams to full varsity status. The ruling in Cohen et al. v. Brown University is the first appeals court decision in the nation applying Title IX to intercollegiate athletics.  Trial Lawyers for Public Justice (TLPJ), is the national public interest law firm representing the women athletes.    ""This ruling makes clear what we have said all along -- if a school wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of opportunities to participate, they can only eliminiate mens teams,"" said TLPJ Executive Director Arthur Bryant, co-counsel in the case.    The class action, filed April, 1992, charged Brown with violating Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions receiving federal funds.  Brown terminated the two womens teams as university-funded sports in May 1991, allowing them to continue to compete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for uniforms, travel, coaches, and all other expenses.  They had also been denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.    ""This is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights,"" said TLPJ lead counsel Lynette Labinger of Providences Roney & Labinger.  ""Universities across America need to reevaluate their programs quickly. Title IX is the law and its going to be enforced.""    Three similar Title IX appeals await decision.  Colorado State University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP), and Colgate University are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders requiring them to reinstate or establish specific womens varsity teams.  Continuing its cutting-edge Title IX activities, TLPJ is representing women athletes at IUP.    In addition to Labinger and Bryant, TLPJs legal teamRay Marcaccio of Blish & Cavanagh and Amato DeLuca of Mandell, DeLuca & Schwartz in Providence; and Sandra Duggan of Philadelphia.  The National Womens Law Center, Womens Sports Foundation, and National Association for Girls and Women in Sports filed an amicus brief in support of TLPJs appeal.  -30- ",0,rec.sport.hockey

So Ill have to make it varialble pricing. But most of them should be about $2 or $3 dollars.   >1991-92 Score Pinnacle (Candian) Sets $45  >This is a very nice set, premium quality cards.

(1/3.4)     D = S  S  c  K  W	    : crater diameter in km 	 g  p  f  n  	       (1/6)     S = (g /g )		    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than      g	  e  t		      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g	is the surface 					    e		      t 			      gravity of the target body.

Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor     Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in     diameter.

The latter was written with     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).      More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John     Snyders USGS publication ""Map Projections--A Working Manual"", USGS     Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. Its a     neat book, all 382 pages worth. This ones $20.      You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,     ""An Album of Map Projections"", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.      You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National     Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS.

" According to the OSF/Motif Style Guide, one should use cursor shapes to give the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. So a ""hourglass"" cursor should be shown when the application is busy, or a ""caution"" cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in another. Defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level. So defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain subpart of it, is a rather complicated matter. When cursors have been defined for some windows, e.g. a ""crosswire"" cursor for a DrawingArea, things get even more complicated. My intuition says that things should be easier, but is this so? If anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem, please let me know. The topics on ""busy cursors"" in the several FAQs are not helpful, since they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window attribute set to None. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Hans GeurtsenNucletron Research BV.

"  ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!    This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary,  ether sucking structures, AND why we observe ""orbital"" motion!!    Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic  waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the  Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.     I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact  that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the  earths surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption  that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)    The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the  development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications  of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!    1   I dream like    The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations  start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it,  converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy.  (non-spinning lattice = ""dark matter"")    The earth isnt exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image  of a galaxy; we havent any videos of them spinning. Picture us  being stationary, and the suns image being dragged across the sky by  the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is  spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner  kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a  faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground  of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but  its ""foot print"" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])      The moon isnt exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self  spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earths ether field, which is  itself in the suns much more powerful field. Our seasons are the  wobble of earths axis, like a top slowing down. The ""orbit"" of the earth around the sun is all of the stars images being dragged around by the suns ether feild.    The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and ""distance""  apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because  the ""path"" is not the same. The moons lattice in the ether is like  sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half  turn. The suns lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has  got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to  the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a ""j"" hook at  the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the  whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.     With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon  can be about as big as ""earths"" shadow upon it, and at other times  totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge,  would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they  look about the same size?

What we are looking at is a rotating ""turntable view""  of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( Ive seen a  half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the  day. Try and draw that ""earth shadow."") Its only the moons image  which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is  the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away  from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.    ""Light-Years"" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is  closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase  of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion.  (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be  essentially happening now. The ""piece"" of light may have experienced  many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.    To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to  de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design  a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like  trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)    To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. Id  look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just  might carry decipherable data. Id start looking on some part of the  spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+  billion humans?) Id totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG  backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card  for Pentium!)    Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound  media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I  would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which  Id start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole.  [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a  two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I  could get with my machines receiver next to it.      If you dont think youll live to see it, considerPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of  lifes data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our  thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By  eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant  instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or  biblical guys did live hundreds of years. Im curios to see what  they did and ate. Dont worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we  dont need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and  that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where  did the household concept immortal come from? Wheat is a weed, it  is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then  die)    Warning about writing to theI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel  future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from.  There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an  Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us,  and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the  others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by  ""advising"" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into  reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that  the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to  provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it  in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his  control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying  that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelvefinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in  our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters fromseemed odd, but we couldnt remember how else it should be. Then  some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no  more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped  through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that  he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body,  existing only on the wind.whose wills are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat  others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a  lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for  playmates.

Careful though, if he likes  your work, but thinks youre getting wise, he can direct you to cross  paths with your old self, and youll vanish as you rewrite your own  course of history, none the wiser.    As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped  back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still  make changes while hes here, its just that that is work, and with  every adjustment, this becomes less the world he cultivated, which  loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less.  But he cant see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had  to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand  to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.     How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country,  our money, and theyre spending it on us, RIGHT? ImagineWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to  congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks  are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big  corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the  banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but  mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14  hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time  to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If  we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if  the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?     In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, ""its chaos!"" They  said, ""no, its order."" He defined chaos as that which is he was not  able to control.    Rainwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no  language.

" We have received a number of requests for a reposting of the International Obfuscated C Code Contest rules and guidelines.  Also some people requested that these rules be posted to a wider set of groups.  Sorry for the cross posting.  Some technical clarifications were made to the rules and guidelines (See the diff marks at the right hand edge).  The rules and guidelines for this year remain the same, so people who have already or are in the process of submitting entries for the 1993 IOCCC need not worry  about these changes.  chongo <Landon Curt Noll> /\cc/\        chongo@toad.com Larry Bassel                            lab@sun.com  =-=  #!/bin/sh # This is a shell archive (shar 3.32) # made 04/05/1993# Source directory /tmp # # existing files WILL be overwritten # # This shar# length  mode       name # ------ ---------- ------------------------------------------ #   8971 -r--r--r-- rules #  25592 -r--r--r-- guidelines #  34482 -r--r--r-- mkentry.c #   6418 -r--r--r-- obfuscate.info # # ============= rules ============== echo ""x - extracting rules (Text)"" sed s/^X// << SHAR_EOF > rules && X10th International Obfuscated C Code Contest Rules X XCopyright (c) Landon Curt Noll & Larry Bassel, 1993.

X XABOUT THISX X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->		      | X X XWHAT IS NEW INX X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS ANDX X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be old the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to anX X	* look at the original source X	* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X	* C pre-process the source ignoring #include lines X	* C pre-process the source ignoring #define and #include lines X	* run it through a C beautifier X	* examine the algorithm X	* lint it X	* compile it X	* execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    cleaned up by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    strangest/most creative source layout need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award worst abuse of the X    rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award worst abuse of the rules X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didnt work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting ""this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake"" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES ANDX X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become old.  We X    tend to see thru masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar wont go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so doX X	#define d define X	#d foo		   <-- dont expect this to turn into #define foo X X	int i; X	j;		   <-- dont use such implicit type declaration X	int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       | X    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    | X    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.	      | X X	int i; X	char *c; X	i[c];		   <--- use c[i] instead X	(i+3)[""string""];   <--- use ""string""[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not beX X	* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X	* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X	* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X	* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X	* performing arithmetic on va_list variables X	* using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading # must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading #, many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programsX X	* are very hardware specific X	* are very OS or Un*x version specific X	     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X	      code is likely not to be) X	* dump core or have compiler warnings X	     (it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item) X	* wont compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X	* abusing the build file to get around the size limit X	* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X	* are longer than they need to be X	* are similar to previous winners X	* are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    best one liner category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -Ds to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -Ds in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self-replicating X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of smallest, lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Dont X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, dont depend X    on color or a given size.  Dont require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Dont use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programsX X	* are as concise and small as they need to be X	* do something at least quasi-interesting X	* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X	* are portable X	* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X	* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X	* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs cant excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesnt have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRYX X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found inX X	This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X	an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X	where this program differs from the contest rules, the X	contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X	contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.

X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    hints file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, dont place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.

X X XJUDGINGX X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, eachX X	---entry--- section X	all ---author--- sections X	all ---info--- sections X	---build--- section X	---program--- section X	any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the any other text file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main prize of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number ofX X	* reading the ---entry--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X	* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X	* passing the source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X	* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X	* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X	    shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions areX X	* linting the source X	* compiling/building the source X	* running the program X	* performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list mightX X	* best small one line program X	* best small program X	* strangest/most creative source layout X	* most useful obfuscated program X	* best game that is obfuscated X	* most creatively obfuscated program X	* most deceptive C code X	* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X	* best abuse of ANSI C X	* worst abuse of the rules X	* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as best.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    best is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OFX X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.

" Several people have enquired about the availability of the book about the Great 72"" reflector built at Birr Castle, Ireland in 1845 which remained the largest in the world until the the start of the 20th century.  ""The Astronomy of Birr Castle"" was written by Patrick Moore who now sits on the committee which is going to restore the telescope. (The remains are on public display all year round - the massive support walls, the 60 foot long tube, and other bits and pieces). This book is the definitivie history of how one man, the Third Earl of Rosse, pulled off the most impressive technical achievement, perhaps ever, in the history of the telescope, and the discoveries made with the instrument.  Patrick Moore is donating all proceeds from the books sale to help restore the telescope. Astronomy Ireland is making the book available world wide by mail order.

"  Hello,  I am testing a port of X11R5 to Coherent, a unix clone OS for Intel architecture machines.  I am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple terminal emulator program).  The problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the server for display, one at a time.  The characters appear to be too closely spaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the  rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the  rightmost edge of the second character, and so on.  It looks like there is an invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous character.  There is no problem between the characters when the shell returns a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual characters.  If anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where I should look to find it, it would be much appreciated.  Regards and thanks, Jon Dhuse.  --   Jon Dhuse              | Intel  Corp.

"  * The Keenan hiring is precipitated by the loss of an anticipated $5M in playoff revenue and fears of losing season ticket-holders (!), plus Paramount chief Stan Jaffes chip against the Flyers over lAffaire Lindros last autumn.  Add to this that Neilsen might return as an assistant coach [Gerald, whatd I say earlier today??], and Roger conferred with Jaffe on the hiring.  This hiring by Jaffe went over the head of MSG, Inc. (Par. subsidiary) head Bob Gutkowski and over the head and the protests of Pres./GM Neil Smith.  * MSG is making the announcement on Saturday to get back at the Islanders for making the playoffs (i.e., steal the press).  * Flyers owner Ed Snyder is livid and beside himself over this.  * Keenan will make up to $900,000/yr.  * Gary Bettman has appointed an independent consul to look at Gil Steins admission into the Hall of Fame.  * New crease colours, rather than blue?  * The Oilers will charge to eat in the Press Room next year.  gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

(which sound thin to me)  The ""face"" is an accident of light and shadow.  There are many ""faces"" in landforms on Earth; none is artificial (well, excluding Mount Rushmore and the like...).  There is also a smiley face on Mars, and a Kermit The Frog.  The question of life in a more mundane sense -- bacteria or the like -- is not quite closed, although the odds are against it, and the most that the more orthodox exobiologists are hoping for now is fossils.  There are currently no particular plans to do any further searches for life.  >Are we going back to Mars to look at this face agian?  Mars Observer, currently approaching Mars, will probably try to get a better image or two of the ""face"" at some point.  Its not high priority; nobody takes it very seriously.  The shadowed half of the face does not look very face-like, so all it will take is one shot at a different sun angle to ruin the illusion. --  All work is one mans work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry ",1,sci.space

Last night during a Sharks broadcast, Commissioner Bettman was interviewed during the first intermission.  He made no bones about it, the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that the current allotment of 26 are fully stable.  This means that cities looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until one team in some location fails or looks to relocate.  This is good, IMO.

Look at Fly by Wire.  >Swept wings--if you fly in airliners youve reaped the benefits.  Phil> Didnt one of the early jet fighters have these?  I also think Phil> the germans did some work on these in WWII.  The NACA came up with them before World War II.  NASA is directly descended from the NACA, with space added in.  Youll notice that I didnt mention sweep wings even though the X-5, tested at whats now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that one dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings dont change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s have sweep wings.  >Winglets.  Area ruling.  Digital fly by wire.  Ride smoothing.  Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...  After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams demonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley Research Center, were giants in the field.  Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  Its true that we used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but that had more to do with availability and need than with military involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was bailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our results and supportive of our efforts.  Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were. General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how successful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)  Phil> Egad! Im disagreeing with Mary Shafer!    The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  On the other hand, all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance to fold the wings--something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base cant do.   -- Mary Shafer  DoD #0362 KotFR NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility, Edwards, CA shafer@rigel.dfrf.nasa.gov                    Of course I dont speak for NASA  ""A MiG at your six is better than no MiG at all.""

I hope that I will live to see the day we walk on Mars, but we need to address the technical hurdles first!  If theres sufficient interest, maybe we should consider starting a sci.space group  devoted to the technical analysis of long-duration human spaceflight. Most of you regulars know that Im interested in starting this analysis as soon as possible.  Ken khayash@hsc.usc.edu USC School of Medicine, Class of 1994  ",1,sci.space

Like fuel for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldnt be worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I dont have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, Ill use it.  But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a low cost (its all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission.  Totalbillion for the US share.  I didnt find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but Id bet that its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious, thats a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of LOX.  And Im not certain if a home brewed (or college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But lets round this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a years supply of consumables and equipment would weigh?  And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled?engines.  Arent they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1?  Ive forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC-1.  All in all, Im not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  Hownon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win.  And for those that didnt give up, I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  Id like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.  Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced, how much lunar material itd need for protection from solar flares, etc.  Unfortunately I dont remember the name of this magazine.

" Brian Yamauchi>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN >news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the ""wild >idea"" stage or does it have real funding?        Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To   SPACE ADVERTISING     First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organizations logos on the space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of    - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)    - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)    - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and    - the GPS/Navstar program office    This has not been considered ""paid advertising"" but rather ""public relations"", since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting a 10 high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is ""advertising"" as much as it is ""public relations"", in my opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]    There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980s which looked at putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload bay.  These ventures would be different than ""public relations"", in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.)    ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES    The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.    Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side, for Arnold Schwarzeneggers upcoming movie ""The Last Action Hero"".  Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the missions Conestoga rocket, its booster rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago.    (As a sidetalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it ""would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation.""   This is being disputed, since the launch is a ""commercial launch"" and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA.)    ORBITAL ""BILLBOARDS""    Orbital ""billboards"" have been the staple of science fiction for some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert Heinlein described another in ""The Man Who Sold the Moon"".  Several different potential projects have been developed, although none have been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the ""Eiffel II"" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the French Republics Bi-centennial.

"  Ive been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. Ive  transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is  granted to copy this without restriction.  Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois. ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which  the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isnt entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tongas case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from  70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and  the Pacific Rim.   RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  Its not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began  negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in  Moscow in such harsh terms that I dont think Ill visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example ""everybody can sell you everything.""   Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who  went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the  Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to  allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied  Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in  Siberia (cant figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is  apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them  specifications, theyll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their  satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They  have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now. *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that ""we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.""  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we arent used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government ""every two weeks"" but we dont worry  because were used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we wont worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the ""equivalent"" value in  rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western  satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much  shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the  difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware.  --  Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu 		    ""Find a way or make one."" 	             -attributed to Hannibal ",1,sci.space

Barrasso has had a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, GAA < 3.0, and  leads the league in wins.  Tommy deserves the Vezina.  Given the lack of  respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason  concerns the Pens team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the fewest goals allowed.

I merely said >that he isnt the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor. >If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup >by now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim  I think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great GM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey- that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better  than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not the coaching abilities.  Which leads to >and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent >enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.  I think at this point theres a personal, emotional element involved here which transcends Murrays logical thought.  As outsiders, its fine for  us to say, ""He should hire a different coach.""  In fact, he has talked about doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to  prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second round.  He needs to, as the papers say, ""get that monkey off his back."" So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but were all a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually hell step down from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will improve as a result.  I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, well see how good of a GM he really is.  >But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM >so none of this is true anyway.

Im so glad we wont have to play them as much next year!) and here comes the 3rd period...what? its the blowout again. Oh they were just waiting for the Cap/Isles to get out of intermission.

While its nice that the NHL is back on American network TV, it faces the same problems as it did with the All Star game.  Local preemptions and zero promotion (okay, I dont watch that much TV so Im just foaming all right?).  The league should have made sure that it was solid on cable before going to the networks.

Well they dont export anywhere near 50% of their GNP. Mexicos perhaps but not their own. They actually export around the 9-10% mark. Similar to most developed countries actually.

Toronto, to the Cup finals???  First of all, has anyone on the planet heard of the team from Detroit?  Al Morgani (or however you spell the idiots name) must be from Chicago, because on ESPN, he said ""its not even close--Chicago will definatly win the Norris Division in the Playoffs, no other team is close.""  Everyone is picking Chicago!  I dont get it, he says its an ""easy choice""? God, Chicago was 1-4-1 against the Wings, and they won the division by a point or two, followed closely by Toronto, who is also a good team! As for the Leafs beating Detroit--doubt it, but even if they do, they arent going to get by Chicago.  If (even more amazingly) they get past the Hawks, they would probably face Vancouver, and lose. As for The Habs reaching the Finals, forget it.  Even I, as a devoted Wings fan, will watch the Penguins easily three-peat as Cup winners.  Lemieux, Jagr, Tocchet, Stevens, and Barrasso, its a done deal.  Sorry Detroit, wait til next year. But hey, these were Pauls picks, and everyone has a right to their own opinnions, but the Leafs to the Finals??? Yeah. If they make it there, Ill walk to Toronto to get some tickets, and thats a 700 mile walk!    --Ryan--  Detroit Red Wings--the forgotten team!  Go Wings!!

" Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):  There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its rings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!  Heres some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have some money available...  John Spencer, 1993/04/21  Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturns rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 ((      1993 May 1-2          A-ring ingress               egress        B-ring ingress               egress        C-ring egress        Saturn ingress               egress        B-ring ingress               egress        A-ring ingress               egress      1993 July 20-21          Saturn ingress               egress        A-ring ingress               egress Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus orbit.  Because the Suns size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km its unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?  Jay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov)   To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July   disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,   etc.  Unfortunately, the  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3   airmasses at  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation thats looking for something   to do?  Id be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.    Jay  and   please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet   disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would   be that its not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and   getting fainter in eclipse, so youll need a big telescope thats a   good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I dont   think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are   well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One   possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but its only a 1.2 m.  jay       ___    _____     ___     /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov     | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |  ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

" Well put, Jason.  I am not from Wisconsin, but I have close relatives who live in Port Washington (about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee), I visit the city regularly, and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals play  and the NCAA Hockey Championships.  It is a beautiful building.  The Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in North America. As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a franchise, word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown County Arena. Once again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of Milwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e. the Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights.

" CONTROVERSIAL QUESTIONS      These issues periodically come up with much argument and few facts being     offered. The summaries below attempt to represent the position on which     much of the net community has settled. Please DONT bring them up again     unless theres something truly new to be discussed. The net cant set     public policy, thats what your representatives are for.       WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS      Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints     have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on     microfilm.      The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it     is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960s vintage hardware (like     guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB     have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch     from.      By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify     the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean     sheet design.       WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISNT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE      Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access     for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an     opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being     ""scooped"" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently     releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early     in a mission.       RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES      There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to     block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium     thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in     worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental     reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.     Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2     RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather     satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months     with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar     module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which     was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in     the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are     expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10     half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].      To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to     pursue     A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel     Salisbury in ""Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG     Controversy,"" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7. Another good     article, which also reviews the events preceding Galileos launch,     ""Showdown at Pad 39-B,"" by Robert G. Nichols, appeared in the November     1989 issue of *Ad Astra*.

IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER      From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from     the Space Shuttles Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible     for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies     indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in     absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The     remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted     study, Charles Jackman.      The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the     stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was     organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space     Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia     (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space     Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and     Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects     of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.      The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric        Industrial	  Natural	  Shuttle     The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are     launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the     total stratospheric chlorine sources.      The effect on ozone is    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability     associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.      The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed     by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally     averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and     Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch     schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be     increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about     the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons     do at the present time.      Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space     Shuttles Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR     Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE      If you *dont* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a     minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your     breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to     watch out for when ascending, and youll have eardrum trouble if your     Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal     experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no     immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do     not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.      Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly ""the bends"", certainly some     [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)     start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from     lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,     youre dying. The limits are not really known.     _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,     Alfred G. Koestler ed., NASA CR-329 (Nov 1965).      _Experimental Animal Decompression to a Near Vacuum Environment_, R.W.     Bancroft, J.E. Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School     of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.       HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED      The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is     a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.     What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank     came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the     astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin     teams medical/forensic report.      The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the     water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks     underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team     examined them, they were sent off to be buried.       USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT      You cant use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit     because it cant get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry     enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.      Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of     that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in     the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly     specialized for travel between Earths surface and low orbit. Taking it     higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would     be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit     spacecraft.      [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]       THE ""FACE ON MARS""      There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid     face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often     published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13     (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).      Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is     artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an     extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the     resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a     smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere     on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, dont     know the address) to study the Face.      The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution     camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this     question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is     best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or     sci.astro.      V. DiPeitro and G.

I have a problem with the cursor within Xterm on MONO (not grayscale monitors) The problem is that when I have an character application that displays input fields in reverse video the Xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the input field.  The solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather than a block, but how do you do this. I cant find any means although various sources seem to indicate it can be done.  When the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block. This would also be preferable but I cant seem to force this to be the default either.

The HGA isnt all that reflective in the wavelengths that might ""cook the focal elements"", nor is its figure good on those scales--the problem is that the antenna _itself_ could not be exposed to Venus-level sunlight, lest like Icarus wings it melt.  (I think it was glues and such, as well as electronics, that they were worried about.)  Thus it had to remain furled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun, so that the small sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded HGA.

All of this is fine.  I never said that Murray was a bad GM.  I merely said that he isnt the best GM in hockey- or even a contender for that honor. If Murray is as great as you claim- the Wings would have won the Stanley Cup by now- probably more than once.  If he was as great a GM as you claim and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success. But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM so none of this is true anyway.  Gregmeister  ",0,rec.sport.hockey

"  After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that Milwaukee should have an NHL team, I thought Id pass along a story I heard recently.  This is second hand, so I dont know how true it is, but I have no reason to doubt it either.  Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge hockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I cant remember his name) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Center.  Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but  turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too high.  Like I said, I dont know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if its true, dont look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals arent going to be forced out of the building and you wont see an NHL club and a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBAs Milwaukee Bucks play there as well.
