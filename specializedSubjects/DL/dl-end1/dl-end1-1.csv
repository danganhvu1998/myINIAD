"  I was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car I saw the other day. It was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/ early 70s. It was called a Bricklin. The doors were really small. In addition, the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. This is  all I know. If anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years of production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you have on this funky looking car, please e-mail.

"      I recently posted an article asking what kind of rates single, male drivers under 25 yrs old were paying on performance cars. Heres a summary of the replies I received.         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Im not under 25 anymore (but is 27 close enough).   1992 Dodge Stealth RT/Twin Turbo (300hp model). No tickets, no accidents, own a house, have taken defensive driving 1, airbag, abs, security alarm, single.   $1500/year  $500 decut. State Farm Insurance (this includes the additional $100 for the $1,000,000 umbrella policy over my car and house)  The base policy is the standard $100,000 - $100,000 - $300,000 policy required in DE.   After 2nd defensive driving course it will be 5% less.   I bought the car in September 1992.  The company I was with (never had and accident or ticket in 11 years) quoted me $2,500.   Hope this helps.   Steve Flynn University of Delaware ======================================================================== 45      (Hope I remembered your name correctly)...

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.   ""If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the 85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.   ""If you buy the Porsche 924, well have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, its another story again - well cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.""   ""But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doenst make sense.""    Thats what the book says.  We dont insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.""   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft.      /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\| |\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyones entitled to MY opinion.   / | |/ ||\|\  \_|\/|_|/|)[_|\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======           ======================================================================== 32   I live in Idaho.

"  My 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose.  I bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment.  I think that is probably enough, along with the usual good diet.  However, he is on at me to get some product called Dalacin T, which used to be a doctors-prescription only treatment but is not available over the chemists counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T, or that Clearasil is OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious.  His father was the same, so I dont figure his acne is going to escalate into something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive about their appearance.  I am wary because a neighbours son had this wierd malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from acne treatment.  I want to help - but with appropriate treatment.

As Roger Lustig pointed out in a previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla, on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.  If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesnt have to hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a years suspension.  In my opinion, thats downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time under whatever conditions, then youd probably have enough people remaining to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I would think that youd reconsider your thoughts.                                       -Sean    *******************************************************************************   ""Behind the bag!""             - Vin Scully ******************************************************************************* ",2,rec.sport.baseball
" For the second straight game, California scored a ton of late runs to crush the Brewhas. It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. Hows this for numbers? Maldanado has pitched three scoreless innings and Navarros ERA is 0.75. The next lowest on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!  It doesnt look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the teams only HR, at .238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, its not hard to see why the team is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesnt sound bad when youre averaging three runs/game and giving up 6.6/game.   Still, its early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo,  Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay, the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen is a big question mark.  In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Todays game with California was cancelled.  --salty  ",2,rec.sport.baseball
" Michael Chen (mike@cunixf.cc.columbia.edu) : In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why? : Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does : Toronto have?  Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters than lefthanded batters.  I just dont understand why people insist on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium). Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters. I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams may be more vulnerable to LHPs than RHPs.  However, this is probably only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters for this reason during the regular season.  I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have higher ERAs than righthanded starters, precisely because managers go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of the platoon advantage).

OR You say that the seventh-day is the Sabbath but not applicable to Gentile Christians.  Does that mean the Sabbath commandment has been annulled?  References please.  If God did not intend His requirements on the Jews to be applicable to Gentile Christians why did He make it plain that the Gentiles were now grafted into the commonwealth of Israel?

"  an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to ""sport"" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets the switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does ""sport"" mode entail?  several 1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)  2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the 	low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and 	would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when theres 	another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is 	depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern 	electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode. 	this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about 	to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as 	little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  im sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.   eliot ",0,rec.autos

" First, I would like to thank all who sent me their opinions on the matter at hand.  All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used.  My friend found out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of my mail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business.  I must have trashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next day & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post he placed in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before realizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he apologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be a snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views & didnt mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither changed his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he knows where Im coming from & now I know where hes coming from.  And all that I can do is pray for him, as Ive always done.  I believe the reason that he & I ""click"" instead of ""bash"" heads is because I see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintaining the status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject God than he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female.  Christianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people from the true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to the world society.  The ""kitchen of heaven"" was all we had to look forward to during the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still exists today.  I, too, have rejected an aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too much hypocricy exists behind the walls of ""Gods house"" beginning with the images of a white Jesus to that of theraise hell beginning Monday.  God-willing, I will find a church home where I can feel comfortable & at-home, but I dont see it happening anytime soon.  Sherlette  ",1,soc.religion.christian
" At the end of a recent (Mon 19 Apr 1993) post, Alastair Thomson offers the following ""paraphrase"" of John    ""God loved the world so much, that he gave us His Son,    to die in our place, so that we may have eternal life.""  The ""to die in our place"" bothers me, since it inserts into the verse a doctrine not found in the original. Moreover, I suspect that the poster intends to affirm, not merely substitution, but forensic (or penal) substitution.  I maintain that the Scriptures in speaking of the Atonement teach a doctrine of Substitution, but not one of Forensic Substitution.  Those interested in pursuing the matter are invited to send for my essays on Genesis, either 4 thru 7 (on this question) or 1 through 7 (with lead-in).

I think your question should be rephrased. The many verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?) Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion of any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well as a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with them.  Todd... ",1,soc.religion.christian

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors (of the squeaky-clean, traditional crew-cut, talk to the AMA before starting any treatment, kind) who recommend treatments that, though ""accepted"", may not be necessary for the patient at the time.  And all for making a quick buck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is significantly inflated by these ""quacks of a different color"".  In fact, Id say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the true focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus on these ""quacks"" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on search-and- destroy-missions to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non- traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.   *************************************************** Now to make a general comment on many recent***************************************************  Lately Ive seen the word ""quack"" bandied about recklessly.

I dont think it is a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown any signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food. She has always been very calm and dare I say, a neat, smart kid.  The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made by Kellogs makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to something in the coating or the cereals.  Of the four of us in our immediate family, Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever, running nose, itchy eyes, etc. but we have a lot of allergies in our family history including some weird food allergies - nuts, mushrooms.

" To what follows, our moderator has already answered the charge of  arrogance more ably that I could have done so, so I will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic.   In a previous article, Eugene.Bigelow@ebay.sun.com (Geno) >>If I dont think my belief is right and everyone elses belief is wrong, >>then I dont have a belief. This is simply what belief means. > >Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when >it comes to their religion.   This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. It is the fundamental premis ""A is not not-A"". If a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic  asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word ""believe"", however. The weak sense means I am not sure. ""I believe Tom went to  the library."" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. ""I believe  that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws."" (despite  the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological  topics.)   >Some take it to the extreme and say that >their religion is the ONLY one and if you dont accept their teachings >then you wont be ""saved"".   Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the  majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity.  (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)   >It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim >to know what God thinks/wants.   It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless  they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks and wants.  >Especially when its based upon your >interpretation of a book.   Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.  >The logic in the above statement is faulty >in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs cant both be >correct.   If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we  may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.   >Its all about perception.

Just because people may >perceive this truth differently, it doesnt mean one is wrong and the >other is right.   Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being  can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find  absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.  >As an example, take the question, ""Is the glass half >empty or half full""? You can have two different answers which are >contradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be >true, does not require everyone elses belief to be wrong.  Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass  is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is halfpoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.)   It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the  same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail to understand each others words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct,  but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other  as in error. --  ============================================================================== Mark Baker                  | ""The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but  aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts."" -- C.

Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.  	I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your  radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.  	Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us  enough to help us through this world?  	I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience,  because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians areexcercises of faith make the faith strong.    	As for you, no one can ""convert"" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.  	May the Lord bring peace to you,  			 			Malcusco          ",1,soc.religion.christian

These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new treatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by  performing studies that are ""blind"" in various ways.  Some of these   o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a       placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the      control group or the test group.    o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects       receive a placebo or the test treatment.    o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to  differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis iswhich it is based so that others can verify it.    It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not ""blind"" themselves.  It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested, the control and test groups are treated alike.

" GB> GB> >(I am excepting migraine, which is arguably neurologic). GB> I hope you meant ""inarguably"".  Given the choice, I would rather argue <g>.  No arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of Leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia).  Migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  The Copenhagen mafia (Lauritzen, Olesen, et al) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura, but like tension-type) they found no changes in LCBF.  From one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  From another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it.  Neurologists treat headache, therefore (at least in the USA) headache is neurologic.  Whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common.  Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients they can get.

But Id like to be >a bit wary about the Copts, Armenians, etc.  Recent discussions >suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from >orthodoxy as many had thought.   With my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration is needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the Copt-Net Newsletter :  Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed to the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played leading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak about the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the Ecumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said that the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their time in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor Marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St. Dioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference wasbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in monophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only one nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.  The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was portrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant believing in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His divinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His humanity were united in one nature called ""the nature of the incarnate word"", which was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two natures ""human"" and   ""divine""  that are   united in   one ""without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration"" (from the  declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures ""did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye"" (also from  the declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of Chalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they wanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian, independent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very strict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the Western Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didnt  quite go the extra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic Church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile ""semantic"" differences between all  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th successor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenoudamore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and terminology are of  little importance to us.""  Throughout this  century,  the Coptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The Coptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has remained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a member  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East Council of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the Christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the theological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and Evangelical Churches.  [...]  As a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign a common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism was condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in Monophysitism.

I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As Andrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil explains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably arent.  Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and Antiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree that there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course of the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got rejected who didnt intend heresy, but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This posting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also a remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called monophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called Nestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his heresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the Antiochene tradition.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

" Living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell, (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized example), and perhaps other uses.  These electric fields change with location and time in a large organism.  Special photographic techniques such as applying external fields in Kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. Perhaps such pictures will be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. Perhaps not.  Studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred years old, but not a popular activity.  Perhaps, except in the case of a few tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  There are some hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding the healing of broken bones, but not understood why.  Bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism.

Very little acne as a teenager. I didnt have any luck with clearasil. Even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when its dry.   Frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. Getting the scalp thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till its softened and washing it out). Taking a one a day vitamin/mineral might help. Ive heard iodine causes trouble and that it   is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. I notice grease  on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating meat).  Keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. Warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads. Body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance. Thats why hair goes limp with oilyness.   Becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. Any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of pimples. Usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there wont be an infection afterwards.  Tell him that its normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes its money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).    -Jackie-   ",3,sci.med
" Michael Bushnell writes;  >The so-called Creed of Athanasius, however, has always been a Western >creed, and has always had the filioque.  The Orthodox have said that >they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but >it is not ""in use.""  Which is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use of the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that has changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the Nicene - Constantinopolitan did not. 	Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene Creed (it wasnt there to begin with), but they certainly did from the Athanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning. 	I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the Son.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see below)  	""Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do call God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the root and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the river are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on that account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there are two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is third from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river, and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray."" 	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)  and  	""I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father through the Son"" 	-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)  And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36, Articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in a more preeminent way.  	""For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the Father alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called unbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of theologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives to the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit proceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of the Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each, however, but proceeds from each and both."" 	-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)  So, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at least), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but in proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the procession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father, the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any mention of the Son being necessary. 	In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope St. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St. Damsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose of Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the Fathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic position, which I enunciated above. 	As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone ""to produce, write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the Fathers of Nicea.""  That Creed is a different Creed than that of Constantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the Constantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of Nicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious, who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the Church, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy Spirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan Creed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves approved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians in Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until many years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was not disputed, I provide more quotes below.  	""Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to God, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly clear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding from it."" 	-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)  	""The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he is the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it isloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him; and again it isis none of His.  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the Holy Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel, that the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father, and that `He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you."" 	-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)  	""The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the appelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to the Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself callsFather, and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father, and `will receive of mine, so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the Son, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit divine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of the Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like soul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father and of the Son, a third by appelation.... 	""The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit breathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor is the Spirit created."" 	-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored, 8 and 75 (374 AD)  	""Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is it necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him, it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to speak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the Son, His Sources."" 	-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)  	Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt, Palastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time, all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church that they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus who all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is not enough to bring up the ""proceeds from the Father"" line of the Creed or the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does proceed from the Father.  Andy Byler ",1,soc.religion.christian

I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with ""Kartageners syndrome"", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic infections. ""Situs inversus"" means that organs are on the wrong side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the ""normal"" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be ""random."" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they cant find the patients heart sounds (because theyre on the wrong side).   According to Harrisons, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking about more than one conditiion.

(As usual, the current edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.)  I do know that the priest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be required.  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid any ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The community provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are involved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of their commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public commitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular marriage.  Where Im not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in exceptional cases (""valid but irregular"").  Ne Temere (1907) says that no marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according to the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new canon law retains this, but Id rather see a more recent and authoritative source.

"  	Jesus was born a Jew.  We have biblical accounts of both his mothers ancestry and his fathers, both tracing back to David.  It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus was Semitic. 	As an interesting aside, Jesus being semitic makes him neither ""white"" nor ""black,"" and in some sense underscores the point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate on. 	Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think its chapter 9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely African.  Because ""Ethiopia"" at that time indicated a region just south of Egypt, many also speculate that this man was not only the first African Christian, but the first black Christian as well.

I inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  I can stick it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  Im not fat, just have a little gut.  My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinch to get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it still hurts.  The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and   muscular injections however--so if its a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent  irritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep,  wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the puncture, and of course, that doesnt feel good.  A way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the  spot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot, and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 "" apart.)  This is from experience, so I hope itll help you.

The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that theres a wide enough variety of images that its possible to understand them either way.

There has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on exactly what the criticism of ""arrogance"" is aimed at.  The arrogance being attacked is that we ""think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are"".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are infallible on the matter of religious texts.  In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can think of epistemology as ""how do you know?""  That question, it turns out, is a very troubling one.  The problem with `absolute certainty is that, at the bottom, at least some of the thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to discover a source of truth is in question.  And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of authority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.   Lets take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional Inerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of Papal Infallibility, too.)  Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and several other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and possibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute Truth.  He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct. His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His conclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made mistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made mistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)  Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own infallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own reasoning, that belief cannot be considered ""absolutely certain"".  Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.  Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.   This is easy to demonstrate.  Lets go back to our shorthand method of doing    teachings and came to this conclusion.    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly? And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say ""I cant prove that there are no mistakes"" -- and as long as you may have made a mistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.  There is no way out of the loop.   This is where the ""arrogance of Christians""that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.  Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.   *  People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to find _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking the idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well), but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is knowably Inerrant.

Note that I said the fall of Rome, not of the Empire.  The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for its fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.  After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter of time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto the rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle should be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of Constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the Crusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd Crusades?

If you want ""meaning"" why not search for the truth?  So far, my understanding of Christianity is congruent with my understanding of truth.

Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  sin.  The Jews of Jesuss time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment"" for sexual sin, what do we do with  diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle? > >In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things. >There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ? >I dont know.  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think youve missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or  some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldnt tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  Ive said this before, but I think its a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed  relationship with God.  Her theology isnt what I would want it to be, but Gods grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (shes had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to Gods intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.  Paul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I  think applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I (or something like that).

As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the ""innovations"" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return to the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.  I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in the Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just instituted the ""Tenebrae"" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for  a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things that I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those ""facts"" were always there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about the differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over breakfast Easter Sunday. > >   As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem >is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of >innovations.  The priests dont seem even to _want_ to make any >decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess its easier to ""try >something new"" than it is to refuse to allow it.  My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music and worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee but listens very carefully to the committees suggestions.  It needs a strong hand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong as it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional reason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual guidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA ""wishy-washy"".   As you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir- regardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes the true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a traditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament of PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth. The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings are not shared by everyone.  I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I dont want  them attending a show.  Its not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful service during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of Worship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such as the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it is Not there.  Quite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and ""fit in"". My dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils would intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who have beared with me this far understand what I mean.  Please keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not to worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something wrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or pastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldnt listen.  They are there to  provide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with the Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change faiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and ministers.

Obviously, if a ""truth"" is not always ""true"" then we have a >> contradiction in terms.    I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a waste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.  For example, I recently was asking some children the question ""What temperature does water boil at?""  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked if they knew what scale, and was told ""Its just 212 degrees.  Any scale. Thats what all thermometers say.""  Well, thats sincere, and may be true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT an absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of  the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.   [example of head-covering in Church deleted]  This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I  see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.   >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  >to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) >Can you reconcile this?  Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.

People sometimes disagree about what is true. This does not negate  >> the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.    I cant prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience. I also trust Gods revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite. Therefore we cant comprehend the Absolutes.  So I dont need them.   I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which God is manifested to Gods creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  Its like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell. Who cares?  It doesnt affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as  well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they live on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on  how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch?  No.    This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true, wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.        Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.        Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,        and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.

Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I dont think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.   >Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake >cars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.    just to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one?

If we admit the possibility that they had lived previous >lives, and that (in accordance with the Asiatic idea of ""karma"") >their present lives are a reward or punishment for past behaviour, >this makes nonsense of Pauls whole point. >  The existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds. There is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I did not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over another as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.  I do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view of an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that befalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater law in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of Christ can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that was completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the flesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental concepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized and mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus Christ to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc. Their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the continuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism). More important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body, the ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate resurrection and judgement on the Last Day.  There is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the tenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind. Clearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma or that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a new impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not refute the disciples question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of course, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only one of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man himself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his parents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of Christs answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.  There is also Matthewthe Baptist,     ""If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.""  This also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching either way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to the human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (""If you care to accept it"").  So I took care to point out, not that the Bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and that much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I pointedly used ""repeated earth lives"" to distinguish a little from the oriental doctrines usually associated with the word ""reincarnation"". The phrase is Rudolf Steiners (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely free from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the most important expression of it being Lessings ""The Education of the Human Race"".  To return to your original point, Pauls statement about Jacob and Esau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma. And both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the incarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus Christ, in my view.

If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what 	. 	. 	.  Why do you assume that Jesuss plea to His Father ""to let this cup pass from Him"", was merely a plea to escape death?  When I look at Jesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the presense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But as that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His presense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it was brought more and more to Jesuss attention (the betrayal of Judas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no avail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not only then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of Jesuss suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical portion was only the tip of the iceburg.  BTW, we know from Johns account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly king.  From JOH            began to say, ""Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the             world."" JOH            force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.  This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an earthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew & Gentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those who would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesuss dismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew what His Fathers will was and followed it obediently even in the darkness of His Passion.  --  John G. Ata - Technical Consultant |HFS, Inc.

" Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat shaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Three picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning and blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).  Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont be taken lightly.  Going into todays game, the had the leagues leading hitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young and Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- David Rex Wood -- davewood@cs.colorado.edu -- University of Colorado at Boulder ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ",2,rec.sport.baseball

Ive got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same problem.)  I havent noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5 years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  Im going to try to take it back to get them to fix it again.

Ive had kidney stones 4 times  and I know the pain she is going through.  First, it is best that she see  a doctor.  However, every time I had kidney stones, I saw my doctor and the only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a urinary tract infection.  The pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones are extremely painful.  My stones were judged passable, so we just waited it out.  However the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  Anyway, if she absolutely wont see a doctor, I suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps an over the counter sleeping pill.  But, I do highly suggest seeing a doctor.

I thought the whole idea of God coming down to earth to live as one of us ""subject to sin and death"" (as one of the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was that Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity, then Jesus ""fully human"" (Nicea) would not be ""subject to sin"", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning, because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish between ""human"" and ""fallen human"" makes Jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most.  > [These issues get mighty subtle.

My impression is that the modern monophysite groups > inherit the entire tradition, not just Nestorius version, and that > some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as > orthodox.  --clh]  First, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestoriuss version -- they  were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as extreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history) claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing (I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean, in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son ""uncreate"" -- surely even  Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestoriuss opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require two seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because Mary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely, if you accept ""Nestorianism"" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined, a la Chalcedon.  Second, I am not sure that ""Nestorianism"" is not a better alternative than the orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesuss human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate nature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed.  Comments on the above warmly appreciated.  Jason Albert  [There may be differences in what we mean by ""subject to sin"".  The original complaint was from someone who didnt see how we could call Jesus fully human, because he didnt sin.  I completely agree that Jesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human.  I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that theres reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was not Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he got the better of them.  However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to Chalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least ""rash and dogmatic"" (as the editor of ""The Christological Controversy"" refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As regular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I think are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from Cyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says ""To attribute also to [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother, either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and Apollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood.""  Its all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have ""to some degree"" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it must be understood that theres a certain indirectness in the Logos participation in these things.  But there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human, or we dont have an incarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area.  You say ""I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesuss human nature was in heaven.""  I dont think thats required by orthodox doctrine.  Its the divine Logos that is eternal.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

We have to remember that we ALL make mistakes in faith, and that because we are human we have an imperfect understanding of the mind and will of God.

Heres a very simele question to which Im sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please answer yes or no, Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs? AL only, please.  For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact that a teams win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the team scores and the number the team allows. Its not a definite, hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs, for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game. So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238 for Boston), the ""Red Jays"" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesnt take into account that Viola pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in (particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and evaluate Violas as better than Morris in the sense that ""had Morris performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.""  >It takes an open mind to really truly understand what is happening out >here in the real world guys.

Most early treatment of non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient. Its an educated guess, by a trained person, but its still no more than a guess. Its cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who dont respond.  There are diseases that havent been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described arent known. (Read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have run out then its the patients freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose. And its well recognized by many doctors that medicine doesnt have all the answers.  This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe its a miracle cure, maybe its valid.

" According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking ""in Xs name"" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus culture authorized to conduct business ""in Johns name"" had full authority over Johns financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for Johns benefit and consonant with Johns wishes.  It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with ""in Johns name""; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of ""faith"".)  With this cultural background, praying ""in Jesus name"" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous ""fiduciary"" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom.  The message of ""praying in Jesus name"" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about Gods delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities.  This idea of praying ""in Jesus name"" is not only present but prominent in the Lords Prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent.  The act of praying the words ""In Jesus Name"" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of Gods Kingdom.  For that reason, Im not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.  Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) dont seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (thats B.C.E. or C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I dont see anything in Christs words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace.

We have reached our goal!  A Hewlett Packard Scanjet IIp was purchased this week.  Thank you to the following individuals whose contributions I just John Sorenson Carol Sigelman Carla Moore Barbara Moose Judith Schrier  Again, thank you to all who gave!  I have been using Wordscan Plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to  review the product.  Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.   It runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett  Packard Scanners.    When initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options;  (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3)  automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image.   I like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which  parts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.  Once an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The  software gives you two ""errors"" at this point.  Blue which are words that were  converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.   Yellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesnt think it converted  correctly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more  credit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue,  you can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal  dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited,  considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary.   After a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word  processor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a  seperate TIFF or PCX file format.  I was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  I use   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  an Intel Satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a PCX/DCX format.   While most of my faxes were received in ""standard"" mode (200x100 dpi), the  accuracy of Wordscan Plus was excellent.   Overall, a very impressive product.  The only fault I could find is the  limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just  too small.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has  been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g.,  Escherichia coliLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences  of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera,  malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore,  control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug  resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease,  salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging  infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those  in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and  minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of  emerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more  effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs  (3).       This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, ""Emerging Infectious  Diseases."" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as  surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and  public health officials.

This report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that  identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from  one restaurant chain. Washington       On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of  Health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an  increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a  case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or  postdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls  implicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset  (matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January  18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants  was initiated.       As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January- February 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the  state health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case  definition of culture-confirmed E. coli(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with  confirmed E. colisymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A  restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients  who recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating  a regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17  through January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30  developed HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years  (     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health,  Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture- confirmed E. coli11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were  hospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13  (93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California       In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was  notified of a child with E. coliActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with  E. coliFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  four at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was  reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27%  increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January  1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as  postdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured,  or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. colionset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993.       Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The  outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen  persons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median  age of case-patients was 10 years (the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community  controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched  OR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients  who ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular- sized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3).  Chain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada       On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten  at a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District  issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea  contact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody  diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness  with a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. colionset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local  laboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools  for E. coliSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of  one patient 38 days after illness onset.       Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine  were hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex- matched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during  the week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence  limit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients  also implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7- 49.8). Other Investigation Findings       During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases  primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November  19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in ""jumbo"" patties produced on  November 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. colilots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed  to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672  (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall.       A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the  United States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing  the likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter  plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one  slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source.       Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in  families and child day care settings is ongoing.

Editorialidentified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody  diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since  emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common  cause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked  most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other  food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been  implicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter  study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. colithat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10  participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a  higher rate than for any other pathogen.

The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea  (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups  and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and  complications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients  develop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,  renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%.       This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community  outbreaks of E. colithe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in  three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington  (1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from  persons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coliWhen infections with E. colito local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public  health action to prevent further cases.       E. colicontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S.  Department of Agricultures Food Safety Inspection Service to identify  critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce  the likelihood of pathogens such as E. coliBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with  pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens  from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be  internally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook  ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices  are clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played  an important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim  recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to  155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993).       Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report  and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be  consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of  outbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of  this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections  caused by E. colicoli References  1. CDC.

Long-term use of  smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of  oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who  currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1).  To monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products,  CDCs 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease  Prevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing  tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian,  noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This  report summarizes findings from this survey.       The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked ""Have you used snuff at least 20  times in your entire life?"" and ""Do you use snuff now?"" Similar questions were  asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of  smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco  use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the  time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having  used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the  time of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and  former users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at  least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as  those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not  smoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on  smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or  equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide  national estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using  standard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN)  (3).       In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users  of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%)  women. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco  use was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was  highest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was  highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan  Natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American  Indians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of  smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was  substantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in  rural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only  for women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1).       Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those  aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of  chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although  women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest  among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years.       An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being  former smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were  former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons  aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users  (56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95%  CI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users  was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5%  95% CI=68.9-78.1).       Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0)  currently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95%  CI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95%  CI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco.       Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3%  95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6- 49.6).   ReportedPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National  Center for Health Statistics, CDC.   Editorialtobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in  particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that  link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral  snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this  behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for  nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4).       Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among  racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels  and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require  further explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role  in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the  differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6).       In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current  smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the  prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco  users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous  study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  occasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked  reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to  stop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health  implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use.       The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special  population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless  tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year  2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more  than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the  prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless  tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts,  enforcing laws that restrict minors access to tobacco, making excise taxes  commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to  routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based  prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit  tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).

Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwigs fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus (21) and Philosophical Investigation (53).  Many of Witts comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witts thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witts own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold.   vonWrightss comment that Witts ""sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.""  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witts own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man.  Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.    This is why Johns Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of ""as a man thinketh, so he is.""  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldnt shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true.    There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancys Sweeties conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.

What Im trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I dont think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God  must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would  honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone  who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are  rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient  for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one  holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is  that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or  revealed that truth.    --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu  [I agree with you.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

Likewise if I say Im a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a Christian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to God proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!  In a similar vein, I have recently been challenged byv3 says ""We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands"" I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that if we have come to know Him, then well obey His commands cos He lives within us and we cannot help but obey what He says. I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically produced in our lives.  Hope this helps.

One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context, scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break the back of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to be filled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is a grave mistake to confuse these.

Rules such as ""support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study"" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.

I would like to submit the following which helped me enormously. If it has already been posted, I apologize.  It seems that during the Middle Ages, it was customary for pastors to  explain the Trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water. Water is water, but can exist in three forms--liquid, ice and vapor. Thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.  And recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which I also found useful--A woman is often percieved by others in three ways, depending on their relationship to her--a mother, a wife and an employee in a business.  Thus, it seems clear to me that the essence of God can subsist in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit or, depending on ones particular need for Him.  Carol Bocher ",1,soc.religion.christian

Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17 wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens career ERA. But I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it would have been a routine groundout, right?  >Whether or not Clemens is better by your standard of measurement >is totally meaningless.

Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.  >>Dont give me that shit.

No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992, gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.  Seriously, Roger, Id really like to hear your explanation of the difference between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher, and why? Did Morris somehow ""learn how to win"" in the intervening ten years? If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half a run lower than 1992?

My 79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started   showing the same behavior.  I replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost   about $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to   rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would   have cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.  The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the   engine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky   part was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench   rounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.    Wow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt   the new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.  This is quite easy even for a beginner.

Moreover the Buddha says that we are  > intrinsically good (as against Christs ""we are all sinners"").  I never thought of these two ideas being ""against"" each other.

Because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking  on water until a little doubt crept in.

Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say how can anyone do this if its so hard even for rich people. Jesus says anyone can do it, with Gods help.  Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people.

I think it is greater  to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but youre right that that might be a cultural bias.

Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots of hits and not many runs.

" My wife and I looked at, and drove one last fall. This was a 1992 model. It was WAYYYYYYYYY underpowered. I could not imagine driving it in the mountains here in Colorado at anything approaching highway speeds. I have read that the new 1993 models have a newer, improved hp engine.   Im quite serious that I laughed in the salesman face when he said ""once its broken in it will feel more powerful"". I had been used to driving a Jeep 4.0L 190hp engine.

Do you spank your kids?      I dont call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.  >3.  If so how often?      I dont call it spanking because its more of a reaction to something very dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running into the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has not been spanked yet.      They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course I give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know theyre still loved.  >4.  Do you use an implement to spank with?      No, that would be too painful.  If its too traumatic they never recall why they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time to go get a toolmeans youre not doing it right away, and that lessens the impact.  Its very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the fact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds - is called a spanking. > >5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?      Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made sure they didnt play together for 5 days so hed know that would make him lose friends very quickly.  Hes never done anything like that since.      We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they dont keep arguing with me over leaving, since its hard to argue with a macine. I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout wont be over until they calm down if theyre too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when theyre really young.  >6.  Your age?      40  >7.  Your location      Bath, Ohio.  Its right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.  >8.  While under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal >offence?      No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to teach all parents that physical punishment isnt always required - parents use that as an excuse to hit too hard.  >9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid      Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husbands have never used spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they were almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And, none of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or Gods law.      Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that ""what ye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.""  The Bible also says in all things to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (ColossiansThere is no room for selfish anger, which Ill admit Ive been tempted with at times.  When Ive felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved a little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the devils work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid to his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking Gods forgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that what I had done was enough punishment. --  Doug    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love missed the 3rd strike in thehe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!""

Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melindas and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.    Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.

" rousseaua@immunex.com writes about heat shock proteins (HSPs) and DNA.  I hate to be derogatory, but in this case I think its warranted.  HSPs are part of the cellular response to stress.  The only reason they are called heat shock proteins is because they were first demonstrated using heat shock.  Dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce ANY protein- because its DEAD!    Also, who cares if the DNA you are ingesting is mutated!?  It will be  completely digested in your stomach, which is about pH 2.    Some of you worry WAY too much.

Not to drag this out anymore, but....  Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area, they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness, swollen joints, +/- fever.  A recent paper (March 1993) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting.  This has been an ellusive matter for researchers, and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease. Up to now, only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to ""prove"" that the disease exists.  This paper is noteworthy in two other 1) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way.  The dogs had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5 months after exposure.  After this period, none showed any further clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study.  So these are proven, clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug treatment. Of course, observations longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesnt have the same chronicity that some see in humans.  2)  The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine.  Of course, they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine efficacy.  Anyway, maybe we will see some independent, scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or so.  -- Jeff Parke <jeffp@pgavin1.vetmed.wsu.edu>Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine class of 1994 Pullman, WA  99164-7012 ",3,sci.med

I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not be investigated.  Many researchers have made breakthroughs by  figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought ""virtually impossible to test for.""  Indeed, I would be surprised if ""candida overbloom"" were such a phenomena.  I would think that candida would produce signature byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the  extent of recent infection.  I realize this might get quite  tricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenient or uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as  ""virtually impossible.""

" Anybody got any good/bad experience with selling their car through one of those car hunters?  Im selling a 1991 Dodge Stealth R/T and I was contacted by this company called the Markham group based out of Illinois.    They said they have 7-10 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldnt be talking to me.  They talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything about my car and said they could sell it no problem.  They guaranteed that if they didnt sell my car in 75 days, I would get my money back ($389) and since I charged it, Im protected by federal law which states that if Im not satisfied, I would get a refund (which is true).  They federal expressed all the paperwork  to me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such.  I called up the BBB in Illinois and they do not have a file on them which is good news.  So they definitely are a legitimate company but so far, its been over week and I have gotten nothing.  So how effective are these types of  companies? Anybody care to share their experiences? ",0,rec.autos

Sometimes a bad choke pull-off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle. The pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a normal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you cant apply suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will cause the diaphram to retract, then its bad and should be replaced.

The following moderators have been proposed and agreed   A BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT AHMADIYYA/=========================================           The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi- sation, was founder in 1989 in Qadian, India. The founder of this sect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major religions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin- duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all the great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger from God have been fulfilled.          The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and extreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris- tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit- nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes. Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many adherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.          The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli- gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth- erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe- cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.          Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin- ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sects internal resources.          The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal religion.   NEWSGROUP==================          When the Call For Votes is called,  the  discussion  will officially  end.   Voting  will be held for about three weeks. If the group gets 2/3rd majority AND  100  more  ""YES/Create""  votes than  ""NO/dont  create""  votes;  the group shall be created.

" Does the Bates method work?  I first heard about it in this newsgroup  several years ago, and I have just got hold of a book, ""How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation"", by Margaret D. Corbett,  (Authorized instructor of the Bates method), published in 1953.  It  talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  Has there been any study on whether this method actually works?  If it works, is it by  actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing  the lenss ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the  too-long eyeball?  Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process, i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  Has there been any recent studies on this?  Where can I find them?  I know RK works by  changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of  eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the  eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (Batess  idea, right?)

" [most recent changes, 15 March                === Welcome to Rec.Autos.* ===  This article is sent out automatically each month, and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups, and some suggested guidelines for discussions.  The keywords `Monthly Posting will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you dont understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there.  Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup rec.autos.tech  is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.  rec.autos.sport  is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)  rec.autos.driving  is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.  rec.autos.vw  is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis, Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list.  rec.audio.car  is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here.  rec.autos.antique  is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)  alt.hotrod  is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles.  alt.autos.rod-n-custom  also not part of the `official hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar American hobby of customizing older cars.  alt.autos.karting  for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.  rec.autos  is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics. Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on thein all of the newsgroups listed.  Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.  Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider settingto point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.  Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.  Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldnt care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos.  It is an excellent idea to check thearticles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three.  The life you save may be your own. There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.  The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing,  the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the following hints about use of theheaders, and on article content.  1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)  2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation.  3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.  4) Use thepossible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put ""ny,nj"" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area.  The Dangers of To amplify a warning from the distribution section of thisBe wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly different from those in Idaho.  The Need for Adequate When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless.   Concerning At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even Honda admits to this.  Please dont waste everyones time by announcing to the world that your `brand x automobile is terrible, so all `brand x automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information.   Concerning As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting):  If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, dont imagine for a minute that including the words `No Flames will work.  It wont, and youll get exactly what you deserve.  If youre going to flame, youre more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions.  Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.   Asking the It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please send email, I dont read this group.  It is a much better idea to end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest Ill summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses to this request.  Answering the If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, dont tell them to get a Mustang. Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, dont tell them to obey the law next time -- its offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesnt directly address the original question.  In general, dont post in order to see your words in print, and dont post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous.   Stale and/or Inflammatory Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some of these topics include the 1)  the 55mph speed limit in the 2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of     radar detectors.  3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.  4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why     rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car group -- everyone would argue     about what constitutes a `sports car.)  5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the drivers     right to own and operate a radar detector  6)  `Buy American discussions  7)  `clever bumper stickers and personalized license plates  8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible  9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?

Make sure to >tell the pharmacist that you want the ""Physicians Package Insert"" *NOT* the  If people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first. Id be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably didnt even come back for followup because they didnt want to admit they wouldnt take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or something.  What people dont understand about the inserts is that they report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific. There are very few drugs that someone hasnt reported a death from taking. Patients dont realize that and dont usually appreciate the risks to themselves properly.  Im sure Herman is going to ""go ballistic"", but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need. I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient. For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly, physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have, as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked things that the patients should have found out from their physician but didnt.  Why they didnt isnt always the physicians fault either. Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They wont be as afraid to ask the system, we hope. --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | ""Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.""  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ",3,sci.med
"    I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid New Car Guide.  What I found was a car would be given a Recommended under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed in a front end collision.  The most highly recommended small car (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small cars listed.  There were many such cases of great vehicles where you wouldnt survive an accident.  Is it only me, or is safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?   ",0,rec.autos

Scientists""  Prof. Mick Noordewier (Rutgers University)  This overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is  intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists  who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain.   Material covered will include structural and informational  molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic  material, the ""central dogma"" of gene expression, and selected  other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as  relates to current computational approaches.  Dr. Noordewier has  appointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and  has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition  to his current work in computational biology. Biologists""  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)  An overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be  presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological  applications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming  languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as  selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge  representation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended  audience includes biologists with some computational background,  but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr.  Lathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has  worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to  biological problems in both academia and industry. in Biological Sequence Analysis"" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos   National Laboratory)   This tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of  intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine  learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely  interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical  neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general  characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such  approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic  views of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical  Division at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such  techniques in this domain. Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)  The genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly  non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally  inspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both  the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and  characteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an  extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size  and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will  also be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to  biological applications, and to identifying resources and software  that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza,  a Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught  this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in  the field. Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania)   & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)  Approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies  are increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of  tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic  pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of  genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the  identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes  in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and  functional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty  appointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn,  represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order  syntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski  has studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area  of word-based analyses.

" 	To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three homer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the  Cards and the Yanks.  He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In case anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe Ruth and is 72.  Mizes record may not last for much longer because of Juan Gonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that  he had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I dont have any record books at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I  am wrong.   	Onto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I dont here anything in Los Angeles and I cant get McPaper consistently around here.that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could  hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish with .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clarks numbers.   leadofflucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  Hes got 4 steals already.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I havent seen Stillwells name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this year is stealing bases. SheffieldWitness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury, or anythingelse wrong with him.  I just dont hear anything. Andythis a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone  seen him pitch the two good games? score for today, Sunday aprilCardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.  Sheffield and Tueful also homer in a winning cause.

" KEVXU@cunyvm.bitnet [deleted] > first paragraph and the mention of pantheism.  Is pantheism ""perverted"" > and ""dangerous"", or just not ones cup of tea?  None of this is clear.  I cant speak for Mr. Cavano, but I understood his comment to refer to  the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to Christians.  If we  unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity,  we can pervert our faith.  When we clearly recognize pantheism when we  encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with  Christianity and reject what isnt.      We need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  We must examine  the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch  and socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.   Philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our  lives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and  service.  The command to love God with all ones mind means no fuzzy- headed drifting from idea to idea.   > and that consumerism and our rapacious style of living > are so rarely called by their appropriate One Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme  in his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions  recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It  too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.  Thank you, Jack, for  pointing out the parallel.   Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne@mmalt.guild.org ",1,soc.religion.christian

I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a  personal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have  with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just  Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.    Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal  sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these  matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them  but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus  anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that ones relationship with God is superior to others, that leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)   >Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu >""At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded."" >                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu  [It is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own ability to know the truth.  There are also different paths in some areas of practice.  But Id like to see more clarification about what you mean when you reject the idea of saying ""their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others.""  If something is true, it is true for everyone, assuming that the belief is something about God, history, etc.  Of course something of the form ""I believe that its best for me not to xxx"" could be true for some people and not others.  I have suggested in the past that God may be less concerned about doctrinal agreement than many people are. But that doesnt mean I doubt that there is a difference between true and false, nor that I think there is no benefit in finding out what is true.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

Well, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  I still believe that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  I would not have progressed as much as I have today, unless I had spent the many hours in Stanfords Med Library as I have done. And 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that  would help me.  So should I have stopped searching.  Thank goodness I didnt.  Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me.    I think that what youve said is kind of idealistic.  That you would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second opinion, and then move on with your life. Just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in  this field in the country, I have received 6 different diagnoses. These are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over the country.  I have HAD to sort all of this out myself.  Going to a support group (and in fact, HEADING that support group) was  helpful for a while, but after a point, I found it very unproductive.  It was much more productive to do library research, make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.  A recent movie, Lorenzos Oil, offers a perfect example of what Im talking about.  If you havent seen it, you should.  Its not a put down of doctors and neither is what Im saying.  Doctors are only human and can only do so much.  But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.  I guess Im biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown.  If I had a broken arm, or a weak heart, or failing kidneys, I might not have the same opinion.  Thats because  those things are much more tangible and have much more concise  definitions and treatments.  With dizziness, you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it.   I have chosen the latter.

" I got asked in Sci. Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production( toxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well  because of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got  into Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium  would prevent kidney stone formation.  Im going to state it again here. But the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6  supplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).  Vitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams  per day).  	1. Review Article ""Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney  	   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C"" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev. 	   5(3):110-129(1985).  But glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both  glycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this  production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine,  but to increase your intake of vitamin B6.  	2. ""Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in  	    patients with kidney stones"" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988) 	    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary  	    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.  	3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria"" Clin. Sci. 38 	   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day  	   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.  For gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is  required for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for  oxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is  quite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.   The pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40%  of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable  and the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto  6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic  acid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the  extra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a  very early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.  Med.increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg  per day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was  increased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose  and 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion  before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average  before supplementation.  B6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There  are probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we dont know about  yet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the  speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must  have an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then  explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C  challenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your  intake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you  take vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient  in B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate  kidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets  absorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day  showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase  in urinary oxalate excretion.  	Here are the high oxalate 	1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea. 	   Contain at least 25mg/100grams  	2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale,  	   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe. 	   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.  If the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot  of latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points  out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your  intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being  absorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldnt  have to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for  males and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake). B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more  per day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).    The USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day  for males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with  this low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6  requirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that  either block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6  excretion in the urine.  Common onesisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to  supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that  increase the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking  birth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the  other drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your  dietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone  formation should be given B6 supplements.  One other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your  Ca/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is  calcium-oxalate.  	4. ""Thepatients with calcium oxalate calculi""Invest. Urol 	5. ""Effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the  crystallization of calcium ininteraction""J. Urol. 143(2):248-51(1990).  	6.Review Article, ""Magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment  of renal calcium stones"" J. Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).  There are actually about three times as many articles published in the  medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone  formation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in  stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier  post in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me. I  guess that he doesnt read the medical literature.  Oh well, since kidney  stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them, I thought  Id tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctors office.

That means, there is no power loss in the drivetrain (if You take out  minimal mechanical friction), and the sami-auto transmissions  (Ferrari, Williams, McLaren(?),...) dont tell You, when to shift, either. However, these transmissions share an important disadvantage with Your stock As long as these servo-shifted gearboxes arent available on  normal cars Im gonna stick with my manual. I just cant see an advantage to make up for two grand I lose in this deal and the loss in mileage and power (except maybe in real heavy traffic). But then I drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway.  Theres no point in making a religion out of this, I just wanted to point out a few technical facts and MY OWN opinion, so theres no need for a flame war.  >eliot  Have a safe ride  Chris  ",0,rec.autos
" In article <foo> Brad Thone <C09615BT@WUVMD>Well, there *is* a difference.  I dont happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, youd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal operating temperature and a `cold one (though I cant remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil wont (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If youre planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if youre making short drives, stick to the 10W40.   -- DONT DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE!

" ******* *******  This is somewhat long, but pleas read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *******    Boy am i glad you decided to read this. Ive got a problem that  I need as many peoples help from as possible.  Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...  OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago.   By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.  OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met. (Shes one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to  mention WAY out of my league...although Im  not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she knows I am a Christian.   Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.  In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but I know it cant be for her). She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....Now we are at the present...  Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....   ""Okay, now Im going to try to explain my life to you. Im not going to KU anymore because something just isnt right. College just wasnt clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and that just isnt my way. I wasnt taking any classes that truly interested me & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was interested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with  kids, but it just didnt work for me at this university. And my parents could tell.  ""So Im working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now I have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room M-W-F. Ive really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and  its great experience.  ""As of now, Im not planning on going back to school in the very near future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to study. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of years. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it wont be to Kansas.  ""Right noew Im discussing a promotion with my boss and district  manager. It looks like Ill train at the store I work at now for about 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when thats done, Ill  basically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to  chose where i would like to manage. Ive pretty much decided on either one of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldnt it be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years?? What do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.  ""This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay and any thye of management experience would look good on an application or resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good benefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time service, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng for me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up  paying out of state tuition wherever I go.  ""Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I  respect your opinion. Ive been completely lost for what to do for  soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really  good. I do like my job although Im about 99.9% sure that i want to do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something. I dont think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female is too bad.   ""Anyway, onto your career decisions. Ill solve your problem right now, MARRY ME...  ""You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously (or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the home life later.""  ***********  OK, well Im sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you think she meant about the marraige thing??   I dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her letter!!! I dont know what to think??  Since she wants to move to the Carolinas should i search out a  Bass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???  I always pick on those people who graduate from high school and get married....but what does she mean???   Ive had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that  I dont date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the Greeks whic as a Christian I cant support-----and here she says she doesnt like the Greek thing either!!  Maybe Im so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am so attracted to paying some real attention to me.  I mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? Im only 19 and she 20....Im only a Sophmore struggling through classes..  I have prayed about this over the past year from time to time.. saying, ""God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..""  Could this be my sign???  I would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes  it worse..  Should I call her?? Im terrible over the phone. I dont even like to talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes.  I mean, what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very average guy like me??  Im really confused....I would really appreciate any help i can get.

"  Thats very true.  I live in Richmond, home of the AAA Richmond Braves, and they have this guy Ryan Klesko who hit 17 HRs at home last year.

Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that Im not sure all the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the    1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of       directions and clues guiding participates around the        Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course       based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will       be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which       they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the       number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately        lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is        set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points       will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions       or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,       basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.     2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants       will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.       Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles       without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half       the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle       unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will       divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified       4x4s can run the course.         At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring   participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.   Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.  * This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles   so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be   street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section   of the course - we dont want to have to separate someones bumper   from their vehicle :) .

" Was going over some videos last night.....  Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very interesting.  And enlightening.  Heres my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep 92, and Jose Canseco, circa June 1986.  1.  Hes bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,     not gain more bulk.  2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, Id say hes     lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and thats a HUGE amount of speed.  3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like     Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is     released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -     Canseco cant.  Also, note that Canseco doesnt always close his     stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,     theyre fully closed.  Without a good starting point, its hard     to make adjustments in your swing.  What would I do, if I were Jose?  Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch, so that Id never have to work again, Id restructure my entire swing.  First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance, and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move the bathead more freely.  Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.  Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength  is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of the park.  If Cansecos open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back problems, hell be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could still hit 600+ HR.   --  *   Gary Huckabay   * ""You think thats loud enough, a$$hole?""           * *   ""Movie Rights   * ""Well, if youre having trouble hearing it, sir,   * *   available thru  *  Id be happy to turn it up for you.

" Hello, 	I am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 89 Honda Civic Si.  I was wondering if anyone could suggest upgrades that were not too drastic.  I thought that one of the easiest upgrades would be a new header.  Does anyone know what kind of increase that the header would give me?  I think I would check with Jackson Racing for the part.  Are there any other comparines would make Honda parts.    	Are there any other small changes that can be easily made and wont screw up the car.  Things like new injectors?, new fuel injection chip etc? I would welcome any suggestions of small changes that would make a difference.  	I dont really want to change the cam etc because I have heard that it would be much harder on the engine.  E-Mail relpies prefered please and I will post a summary of all the replies.

The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, Ill grant, but its not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)

But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true and `infallible.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think its unlikely that Im misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, Ive tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I havent, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I havent attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that Im fallible and so theres some chance Im wrong.  Dont get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, its not my fault -- Im just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  Its one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But its not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

Part of that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play third.  >Williams, Matt       ----  ----  .633  .653  .656   0.647 Add another to the elite fielders list.  >Caminiti, Ken        ----  .675  .630  .653  .596   0.642 >Sabo, Chris          .751  .626  .616  .613  .575   0.642 Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.

Each year hes about 10 points below average.

Im no mustang head, but dont the early ones have a simple strut suspension (that is, with no upper A-arm)?

Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening the strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the intended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore the suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer is the only way to go...  --Ken --  Ken R.

Unfortunately, this isnt true.  On another news group earlier this year, someone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version of the Bible in English and was, therefore, inerrant; all other English translations were from Satan, trying to deceive the body of Christ.  A few years ago, the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations.

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph, nor do they reach 155. However, using `high to be 70-90 a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. Ive done several 1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800 miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. Im sure I   would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles. No problems with winds and curves.   Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.  b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.   >|> b) I cant understand why these high-scale European marquees are afraid >|>    to design engines that can be repeatedly revved to near redline in >|>    the low gears.

" Desiree Bradley (Desiree_Bradley@mindlink.bc.ca) <. . ..  : The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites : take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except : for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about : Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that : the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered : me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I : shouldnt be so troubled about the reports of ""ethnic cleansing"" in : Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldnt be with the Moslims. : Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians : who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing : Gods work?  Perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very act of killing.  Does it reflect the attitude of God, who sends rain to both the just and the unjust?  If not, then Christians should be uncomfortable with it.  Jesus gave his followers the law of love to follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known.  Doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so I dont see why Christians should be moved against the Serbs because their ancestors converted from Christianity to Islam.

Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted, additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.    Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasnt been in use that long, and it really isnt clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because long-term effects, if any, are not known?

Seems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion and reality on your own you wouldnt need to rely on doctrines that need to be updated.  My experience of Christianity (25+ years) is that most Christians seek answers from clergymen who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matters, and that most of these questions can be answered by simple introspection.  Most people suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.  Not to get too esoteric, but it seems that most religions, Christianity included, are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand this.

Does it make sense that she (or I, or the majority of humanity for that matter) would go to hell for eternity, as many  Christians believe?  It makes more sense to me that rather than be converted to a centuries-old doctrine that holds no life for her, that she simply continue to decide for herself what is best.    --------------------------------------------  [You may be right about Christians relying on clergy, but I have some reason to hope youre not.  Protestants emphasize conversion, experience of the Holy Spirit, and use of the Bible.  This is intended to make sure that Christians have religious experience of their own, and that they have some basis on which to judge claims of clergy and other Christians.  I cant speak for Catholics and Orthodox, but I believe they also attempt to avoid having members who simply repeat what they are told.  I admit that this isnt always successful -- we certainly see young people join our church because at that age parents expect it.  But most of our members do seem quite able and willing to make judgements for themselves, and have a commitment that comes out of their own experience.  Unfortunately, its the nature of Usenet that doctrinal disagreements get emphasized, so it looks like we spend most of our time dealing with doctrine.  Thats certainly not my experience of the way Christians really live.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

Consistently hit at or near 300   while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfields   slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that   dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was   one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit   the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new   Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence   since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his   hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds   of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an   uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,   and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George   inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the   Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?   For 3 million dollars, hell play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5   million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play   the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should   give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age   of Yankee domination.

Baseball is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping Lopez on the farm then thats what the Braves *should* do.  I happen to believe that its a baseball decision.  While you from your armchair may disagee, I dont.  I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It may also be logical.  I dont know what ethics have to do with it. Seems like pretty good common sense to me.  --	The Beastmaster   --  Mark Singer     mss@netcom.com ",2,rec.sport.baseball

The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde >produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to >living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.    [...]     In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION    LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What    follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.     [Reproduced without permission]  	   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England, 	where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under 	the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and, 	presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if 	a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group 	of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and 	sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after 	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage. 	   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a 	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public. 	However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers 	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did 	actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not 	necessarily go hand in hand. 	   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining 	the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted. 	And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the 	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins 	University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame- 	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in 	the amount of food eaten afterward.  	   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing 	cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a 	host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government 	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing 	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety. 	Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and 	after the sweeteners entering the market have failed to confirm 	that it can bring about adverse health effects.  Thats why the 	Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with 	monitoring public health), the American Medical Associations 	Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration 	have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a 	clean bill of health. 	   Granted, the FDA has set forth an ""acceptable daily intake"" of 	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed 	the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take 	in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of 	aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt, 	or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,... 	A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams 	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups 	of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content 	of selected foods omitted] 	   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away 	from	phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000 	to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential 	amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child 	consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause 	such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with 	PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other 	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning ""	Contains Phenylalanine.""   -Rich Young (These are not Kodaks opinions.)

Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:) I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.   As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.   >Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate, >The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line >and waving lankford home, > I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make a perfect throw?   I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Dont forget the overachieving Cards of 91 that won all those close games and went from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/ Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading in the right direction.   One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds, but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they lose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

" Frequently of late, I have been reacting to something added to restaurant foods.  What happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel ""puffy"", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.  The situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants (usually chinese), the most notablechain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese fast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.  I am under the impression that MSG ""enhances"" flavor by causing the taste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable to assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.  Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above) involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is what I suspect as being the cause.  I wouldnt be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.  Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied they know of.

I do think that a liturgy committee has a >bias toward doing something rather than nothing--thats just a fact of >bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for >people to be aware of the Lords presence.     As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of innovations.  The priests dont seem even to _want_ to make any decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess its easier to ""try something new"" than it is to refuse to allow it.     At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet (""Who wants to get around peoples feet,"" according to one of our priests) the congregation was ""invited"" to come up and help wash one anothers hands.     The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to participate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with rubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. ""Body of Christ"" -- ""Amen"" for receiving Communion), that they could be ""I am not responsible for the blood of this man.""     Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (""Blessed are You, God of all creation..."") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The priest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to others, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion that night (we arent required to anyway -- I instead offered up prayers for our priests and parish).  >So weve been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass >going down?  I dont mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or >Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware  >of Gods presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should  >just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational >participation in Catholic Masses lately?     The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would still be ""liturgically"" beautiful.  The problem comes about from people trying to be ""creative"" who are not.     I think the answer to your question on participation could be that given by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by the title of Thomas Days _Why Catholics Cant Sing_.  ""They dont want to"" because of all this nonsense.     By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does not reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are disobedient to the Church in changing it on their own ""authority.""  -	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	- Steve Creps, Indiana University creps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu ",1,soc.religion.christian

I know >that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet >hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying You fools, >do you still think that just believing is enough?  Actually I dont think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the  meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere  belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your  belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this  is what James means when he says that ""faith without works is dead""  and, ""I will show you my faith by my works.""  Remember James was  writing to ""the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.""  This  probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much  later and wouldnt understand the meaning of the original Greek. (Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he intended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek.  Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Pauls statements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great burden of Pauls life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people, then the ""Judizers"" would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf Acts chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood of Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think ""faithfulness"" today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended.  >Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves >and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.  I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not ""keep kosher"" to a kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.  >But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to >him (i.e. doesnt know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who >knows and believes in God but doesnt make any attempt to live by the bible.  In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and  be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are  worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price (Matthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Matthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.  [I agree with you in general, including the fact that ""pistis"" has some of the force of ""faithful"".  However if you take that too far, you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have intended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins.  I assume thats not what you meant.  I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what Id call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and commitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic change.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show the new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that Jesus calls being born again.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

Does anyone know for sure whether this applies to PRK as well?  Also, why is it possible to get a correction in PRK with involvement of only about 5% of the corneal depth, while RK is done to a depth of up to 95%?  Why such a difference?  I thought the proceedures were simmilar with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in PRK.  I must not be understanding all of the differences.  In the FAQ, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than with glasses alone.  If this is completly attributable to the intentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when necessary with glasses (or contacts, if they CAN be worn afterall!).  It is important to know if that is not the case, however, and some other consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.

Every time it arises, it causes | months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly. | Basically its because the Law was given to Moses as part of a | specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us arent Jews, so we | arent part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in | Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to | Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this | debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but | keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles | concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians, | and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.  1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Romdid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).  2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised ""what ever He says to do we will do.""  That is why the new covenant is based on ""better promises"" (Heb.God promised to ""put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts"" (Heb. 3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 4.  Israel stands for Gods people of all time.  That is why God *grafted* the Gentiles in.  Romacovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough ""For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel"" v 6.  Then in GalAbrahams seed, and heirs according to the promise.""  All Christians are Abrahams seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites.  |  | While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us, | because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews, | we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected | from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, its the | same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this. |  | These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments | into ""moral"" and ""ceremonial"".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to | the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are | thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to | everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except | for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take | this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on | the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to | worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians | are free to choose the specific time we worship.  People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). |  | A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin | and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer | binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior | should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still | useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally | binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not | believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While | we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, its not safe for us to go | into situations with no principles to guide us.  Were too good at | self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral | guidance, from things like Jesus teachings, Pauls advice, etc. | These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same | function as, and have largely the same content as, the ""moral law"" in | the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed | legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that | given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important. |  I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do I walk out of the court saying ""I can now go on speeding, for I am now under grace?""  Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom.faith?  Godholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good"" (Rom. | In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of | tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christs | resurrection.  Theres some debate about what Acts shows about early | Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish | Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but | that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then. | Act| implies gatherings on that day. |  | There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to | worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day | Adventists and Jehovahs Witnesses.  They argue that Act| regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and | that I Cor Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate ""lay by him in store"" with ""go to a worship service."" |  | Its clear that this issue was a contested one in Pauls time.  See | Rom| judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific | day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that | specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his | worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the | Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue | that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col || mentions Sabbath.)  Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath day of the moral law. |  | There are some differences among Christians about use of the word | ""Sabbath"".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish | day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the | day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply | the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering | schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It | distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated | for Jews, and the Lords Day -- which is the free Christian worship. | (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev| are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians | support ""blue laws"", both in secular law and church law, setting aside | that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical | anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish | Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the | Lords Day. |  Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate Gods name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God.  Darius  [Its not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I think Pauls comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally accept that those who ""esteem all days alike"" are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord.  However Id like to be clear that I do not think theres unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.  The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else.  They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says ""and they gathered every Sunday for worship"".  We get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.    Actworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath.  ActsChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesnt tell us what day Christians met in their houses.  Actsconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesnt say they gathered to see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But thats just not explicit enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Corthat on the first day they should set aside money for Pauls collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I cant disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. So I think the most obvious reading of this is that ""on the first day of every week"" simply means every time they gather for worship.    I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.

" Most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this, but the Branch Davidian compound is no more.  This morning aboutthe feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  They  then started using non-lethal tear gas.  Shortly after noon, 2 cult members were seen setting fire to the compound.  So far, about 20-30 people have been seen outside the compound.  The fate of the other 60 or 70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were inside.  The compound did burn to the ground.  Koresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed off and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come out peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that his message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didnt come out. He claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said that God told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in Revelation, and when he was finished, hed come out.  He finished the first one, but didnt do any more work that anyone knows of since then. The federal agents did warn him that if they didnt come out, they  would be subjected to tear gas.

" (SUBMISSION ON THE SAME TOPIC WHICH I SUBMITTED A FEW MINUTES AGO.)  I think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning.  Regardless of how the word Easter *originated*, the fact is that it does not *now* mean anything to Christians other than the feast day of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.   The meaning of a word is _only_ what people understand it to mean.  And the same goes for other cultural practices.  The festival of Easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival, but *today* there are, as far as I know, no Christians who *intend* to honor any kind of ""pagan goddess"" by celebrating Easter.

" dhancock@teosinte.agron.missouri.edu (Denis Hancock)   > [A very nice article on the DSS, which I thought answered    >  David Cruz-Uribes original queries quite well]     Here are some books I have read recently that helped me not only    prepare for a 5 week series I taught in Sunday School, but greatly    increased my knowledge of the Qumran scrolls. [...]  One other recent book I would heartily recommend is Joseph Fitzmyers _Response to 101 Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls_ (Paulist, 1992).  Fitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern NT scholars.  He was also one of the early workers on the DSS.  His book is written in a straightforward Q&A that allows it to serve as a source for a great wealth of clearly presented basic, up-to-the-moment information about the DSS.  (This book is something of a companion volume to Raymond Browns _Response to 101 Questions about the Dead Sea Scrolls_.)  Nichael  Pop",1,soc.religion.christian

" He doesnt contradict himself.  The church is to last for all time. However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This is evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the ""super-apostles"" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 Thessaloniansabandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothysearch for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 TimothySuch passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthewas a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.""

"  Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also  widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity.  And in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is  indicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a   perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might  make that he is unable to even leave the house.    In science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible  and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these  discoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata  --- the search for scope and the search for certainty.    If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and  Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither  of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since  they lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of  a rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus.  It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid  grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton  and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great  deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost  through the mistakes they made.

These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology.  According to these posters  ""If its not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then its not science.""  Taken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies  are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification  of science.    For one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology  results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside  the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have  no chance to obtain a hearing.  (I dont in the least believe that this  is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless,  it is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has  certainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish  arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment  --- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come  with anything worthwhile.    Furthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is one of the most significant errors inquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance.  For instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative. (One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpins assertion that current scientific methods ""avoid all known errors."")  I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental  error in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the  others.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all  too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are  worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.     lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet ",3,sci.med

Elevated levels of Glu and Asp in the blood are able to bypass the Blood-brain barrier through the circumventricular organs (or CVO), in particular the adeno and neurohypophysis (pituitary gland) areas.  The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the median eminence regions are particularly effected.  CVO areas are not subject to the blood-brain barrier. These areas control the release of gonadotropin, which controls the release and flux of steroids governing development, especially sexual development. Changes in adult rats, which are less sensitive to Glu than humans, have beenon a chronic basis, cycles of several steroids are disrupted. Blood levels of somatostatin are significantly reduced, and cyclic release of steroids becomes flattened.                      Hope this helps.                     --Dianne   ",3,sci.med

"  	The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time.  The problem is, in a nutshell,symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for Gods grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldnt dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and explain what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesnt help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result oftunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesnt work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particularthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.

You might also be helped by the treatment in Dantes DIVINE COMEDY. Heaven occupies the last third of the poem, but I cannot imagine reading it other than from the beginning.

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris contribu- tion  from the rest of the teams.  There is only one way of determin- ing ""best"" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro- cess  used to determine the ""best"" is the score of the game and it re- lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.  To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab- solutely  that  player As team would have played better with player B in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.  If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the individuals  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the only measure of ""best"" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base- ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham- pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub- jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.  >The fact is that Morris didnt ""win"" any ballgames, Toronto did, in >spite of Morris ""contribution"".   This has been explained to you  Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens. I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.  >many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.  You dont have to be rude.  >You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.  For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an individuals  performance   from that of his teams for the purpose of comparing that individuals performance with another individuals per- formance.  The stats are a nice hobby and  thats  about  it.  There  is  no  new knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less  incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.  --   cordially, as always,                      maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca                                             ""So many morons... rm                                                   ...and so little time.""

" Howdy,  Im a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the knowledge and expertise available here.  The  TheI recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isnt just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  MyWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isnt going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably cant expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anythings gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (yknow, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you couldve guessed it being an 84, but Im just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speednegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasnt paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  Im pretty coordinated, so this doesnt bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but Im ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But Im not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help 	1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a 	    device? 	2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC? 	3.  Are ""professionally"" installed CCs signifacantly better and 	    worth the cabbage? 	4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just 	    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple  	    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically, 	    the questions above)?  My father and I built a ""Veep"" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesnt scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share some of your wisdom, please email as I dont get over this group very often (but I check my mail all the time).  Again, thanks for any help anyone may have.

" {I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}  The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents  is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, ""Hermeneutrik und  Kritik,"" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of _Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Beck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The  Prophetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 ((If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley describes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader.)  Nibleys extract from Blasss work is in the form of ""rules for forgers.""  It makes interesting reading.  I confess that I have not read Blasss work, only Nibleys extract thereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and as far as I know there is no English translation available.  However, I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that  any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one  would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not  be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to  determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and  culture or is a later forgery.  Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient 1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example the Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found with them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects.  2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several generations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still  be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself.  It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the document and identify its culture of origin.  For example Ive heard of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king in what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the holograph).  They could check the language, content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a Palestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually wrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but (barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for  comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was.  As I say, Im no expert on Blass work.  I do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.   Specifically we might 1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict itself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to  maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The  longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency. For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.  2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time? Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous  and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.  3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech etc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that  seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?   If so do they fit in with the culture?  Of course there are complications if the document has been translated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but dont necessarily prove forgery.  These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work  with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the  historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to  ask are, ""Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we  know about the culture of claimed origin?""  If there are things  which dont fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really  significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture.  The end result of any such testing is occasionally certain (particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies). However often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document (or maybe parts of it) is probably authentic (or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions).  This is often  unsettling to a generation raised on TV where all problems are solved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials.  It is,  however, the real world and what scholarship has to offer. ",1,soc.religion.christian

(Stay close to            your home bathroom.)                 4th          dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS            CONTAIN LAETRILE.).                 5th          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and            add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).             Drink one glass per hour.           [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day            every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH            PULP.]                 6th               7th               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each            day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements,            plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.             (2) THE GRAPE DIET.                 Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to            8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the            six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want.                   (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.                Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple            cider ""flavored"" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a            glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.             Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a            week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal            healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially            effective against those types of cancer that resemble a            FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections.                     (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]                Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level            comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.             Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely            dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt            (regular salt wont work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda.                 Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising            your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your            stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down,            chomping your teeth together, etc..                 Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes            the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the            book ""Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2"", by Frances Nixon, 1973.          prepare it and drain it.           For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away            from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly            expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt            other peoples fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at            least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.             (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take            a 2-Billion-bacteria ""Acidophilus"" capsule, which is also an            EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF ""A.I.D.S.""            (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the            digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune            system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal            bacteria, it may also be a CURE for ""Lyme disease"".]           Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder            storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during ""Major"" or            ""Minor Periods"" as listed in the ""Solunar Tables"" published            bimonthly in ""Field & Stream"" Magazine, (because of the            measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields            present at those times).           Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year.                    (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER                       For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the                 affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons                 per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for                 about 2 months.                          D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to                 perform NORMAL cell functions.                  ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.                  To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.                  To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per                 day.                [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.                  IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer                 cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile                 into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is                 ALSO present in the digestive system.)]                  ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include                 Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most                 people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A                 (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide                 Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up                 to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-                toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime                 will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types),                 suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes,                 prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not                 cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST                 ""A.I.D.S."", which is really a form of cancer similar to                 leukemia.]  (See the book ""Life Extension"", by Durk                 Pearson and Sandy Shaw.)                  HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3%                 hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably                 DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day,                 hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.                  Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers                 several times per day.                Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good                 daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants                 described above.                  VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and                 much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA                 doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources.                  Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell)                 NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on                 and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an                 aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-                radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with                 daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH                 magnetic fields.                  Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES                 can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well                 as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics                 Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos                 of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays!                  INTERFERON tablets.                 TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho).                             HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical                 problems (even drug addiction!).                  50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure                 prostate trouble.                  This list is NOT exhaustive.              The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-           DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent            and cure many other medical problems including heart-           diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work            effectively.             Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these            remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send            a strong message to ones subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it            to CURE the cancer.             In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer,            then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies            described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast),            BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations            and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer            treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!].          that have shown themselves to be reliable.

While I cant think of any Corvettes with side mounted backup lights, I know that Saab started using them about 15 years ago.  My 1975 Saab 99 didnt have them, but a friends 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who dont remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber ""parking lights"", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white ""cornering lamps"" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white ""backup lights"" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kids toys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the wheels turned while backing up.

Let me carry that a step further.  Most doctors would not claim to be  infallible.  Indeed, they would generally admit that they could conceivably be wrong, e.g. that in this case, a blood tranfusion might not turn out to  be necessary after all.  However, the doctors would have enough confidence and conviction to claim, out of genuine concern, that is IS necessary.  As fallible human beings, they must acknowledge the possibility that they are wrong.  However, they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable, and stand by their convictions.  --  Virgilio ""Dean"" Velasco Jr, Department of Electrical Engg and Applied Physics  	 CWRU graduate student, roboticist-in-training and Q wannabee     ""Bullwinkle, that mans intimidating a referee!""   |    My boss is a     ""Not very well.

" I know its a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will have some comments to share.  The story isthe safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has  aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they wont pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says its illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you cant have tint, if you cant see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said ""Its just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now."" Well, wont argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says its OK as long as you can see through the tint, Id like to keep it (Ill re-read the vehicle code in the library).  Id also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says its OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I wont get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldnt mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!  Michal  ",0,rec.autos

" Hi Damon,  No matter what system or explanation of creation you wish to accept, you always have to start with one of two premises, creation from nothing, or creation from something.  There are no other alternatives.  And if we accept one or the other of those two premises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was random, or was according to some plan.    If it was random, I am unable to accept that the complex nature of our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures could exist as they do.  Therefore I am left with creation under the control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme.  I call that intelligence God.    I also prefer the ""Creatio ex nihilo"" rather than from chaos, as it is cleaner.    There is obviously no way to prove either or neither.  We are and we must have come from somewhere.

While I agree with most of Jon says (I deleted those parts, of course), I  have serious reservations about this advice.  Maintaining a `just  friends level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People  usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when  they start off with feelings of attraction.    When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement.   Ive had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldnt  date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to  believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each  other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to  their original state.    This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home  and fellowship.  I dont think it would work exactly this way for most  people.  However, its important not to underestimate the power of  feelings of attraction.

Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This doesnt mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.    Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isnt.     I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesnt mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement.   First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ  could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the  male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.   Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.   Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option.   Im not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32 alternative health therapies.]    ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the   1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to illuminate   their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object   was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its   surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner   structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found   too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead   and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones   were subject to changes.  The objects life activity was also visible in   highly variable colour patterns.    High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in   the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up   seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at   Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and   others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.    Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around peoples   fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on   healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers   but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and   spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose   diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that   in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person   isnt actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to   foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.    But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is   the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from   which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the   leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely   important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can see   the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing   about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern   cant possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would   vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid   contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than   the actual object itself.

An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims, and some of the authors favorite examples of hokum.]    The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of   study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal   movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for   instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will   emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and   hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that   the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian   photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.   Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings   in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on   the surface of the body and not to mysterious ""auras"" or even   necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,   television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous   parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of   the unknown.  --  Peter Kaminski kaminski@netcom.com ",3,sci.med

Andrew,     How I wish this were true, and how I long for the day in which it will be true.  But alas, it is not true of history.  The Bible does not have a  message -- it has messages.

Like the isrealites order to  wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and  punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.  Like jews who are said to have cried out in Matthew, ""His blood be upon our heads and our childrens heads"" A verse quoted in every pogrom from the crusades to the holocaust.  Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only been understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent  symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text. Understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred corpus, we test all things and hold fast to that which is good.  >  >  > p.s.

Of course I believe in Predestination.  Its a very biblical doctrine as Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4).  For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those without that grace cant be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell. 							  ^^^^^^^^^^^ People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.  >yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that >punishment at the last judgement.   Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those He cant bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, Davids sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of Gods judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible.

But in the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a ""just war.""

Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us.  Andy Byler ",1,soc.religion.christian

I loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just couldnt stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the problems that I had, but know this, its not just the car, it is the ability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any chrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I dont care if there are going to reform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe it when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up, just looking, you dont even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10) salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you, and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards. Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of work/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care of this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took it to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldnt have been.  1988 Dodge Shadow ES  These were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.  Engine  4 Alternators Rear Suspension Torsion Bar 2 Water pumps 5 thermostats Hall effect sensor Main computer 4 Batteries  These were rebuilt/repaired  Radiator Automatic Transmission Power Steering   Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For about a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, its a good car, I just cant find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I traded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I just stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000 worth of repairs over its lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite me.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.  You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but Japanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I feel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler product again, no way.  I dont care how good the LH cars look good, and I will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM isnt much better, thank god, they dont control Saturn, like they do their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.    Dont get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car is really good, until it has proved itself to me.  But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.  And although there are alot of people who dont like Consumers Reports, I will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the chryslers rate a better than average, I think the best one is just average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LHs.  You can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal of information about this company, just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote, ""We are watching them very closely.""  Come on, everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They are still struggling because they havent learned yet.  They have the ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date, but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.

"      I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to both stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the  big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he  had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.     Now here are my opinions of the two stations competingMorning  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi,  and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he interjects humor and politics into his show. 10 AM to 12  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller who is asking about who the local team is going to draft in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless it was a major story.   I would consider this even because they are two different styles of host.  12 Noon to 2  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to  Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability to transcend the ""homer"" mentality of the Philadelphia fan base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia  spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan. Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0 score without the egging of the hosts(I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on  either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and you cant get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.  2PM to  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and  Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining, but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10 to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which are often hilarious.    4 PM to 7  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like Mike Missanelli but I just cant stomach Steve Fredericks.   I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly homer now.  I dont listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there is a game on that night, but you will see later for the  reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.  7 PM to  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show) On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets Jets, or St. Johns basketball.  If the game is on the west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season. (If this is the sports station, why did they lose the IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.)) During the summer, it is all talk on WIP.   Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and 12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

The answer to both questions is yes.  All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a  contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a ""truth"" is not always ""true"" then we have a contradiction in terms.    Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldnt we conclude that the statement, ""There are no absolutes"" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.  >There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical  >Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding  >Biblical interpretation.  So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankinds sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.   --  Virgilio ""Dean"" Velasco Jr, Department of Electrical Engg and Applied Physics  	 CWRU graduate student, roboticist-in-training and Q wannabee     ""Bullwinkle, that mans intimidating a referee!""   |    My boss is a     ""Not very well.

The amount of language instruction available at US seminaries varies widely, mostly depending on the denominational heritage of the school.

The pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for first-year students to take intensive five-week introductory language courses in each language, followed by semester-long exegesis courses.  (ThatAugust, OT exegesis in the fall; Greek in January, NT exegesis in the spring.)  These courses are required for graduation, a third or a half of the students, Id say, take advanced biblical work that requires language work. ",1,soc.religion.christian

In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished.     But dont forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of ""Let his blood be upon our hands"" of the crowd in Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament.  Dont you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, ""Mene, mene, tekel, peres?""  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of Gods justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel.  The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of Jesus Christ is ashand.""  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - ""Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.""  There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, ""well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans.""  He said ""Follow me.""  His message is NOT ""Im just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, youve got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, thats only a fairy tale.""  ""Our great God and Savior"" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.  D. Andrew Byler ""Does not He who ways the heart perceive [sin], and will He not judge men according to their works?"" - Proverbs 24.12 ",1,soc.religion.christian

Of course we cant hope (currently at least) to explain how or why Kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails. Surely it wasnt the *only* daydream he had.  What was special about *this* one?  Could it have had something to do with a perceived *analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules?  Is such analogical reasoning ""extra-scientific""? Or is it rather at the very heart of science (Perices notion of abduction, the use of models within and across disciplines)?

Some said that their heart beat speeded up with flush face. Some >claim their heart ""skipped"" beats once in a while.  Both of these symptoms are related - tachycardia. Getting a flushed face is due to the heart pumping the blood faster than a regular pulse.  I suspect this is related to an increase in sodium levels in the blood, since note *sodium chloride* monosodium glutamate. Both are sodium compounds. Our bodies require sodium, but like everything else, one can get too much of a good thing.  >Some reacted with headache,   Again, this could be related to increased blood flow from increased heart rate, from the sodium in the MSG. Distended crainial arteries, essentially. One of many causes of headaches. There is no discrepency her, necessarily.   >some stomach ache.  Well stomache ache and vomiting tend to be related. Again, not necessarily a discrepency. More likely a related reaction. Vomiting occurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has eaten. If a person cant digest the stuff (entirely possible - the list of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an enzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly ache) would be expected.   > Some had watery eyes or running nose,   These are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar to vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious compounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible some other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the symptoms. But its important to remember that a lot opf these effets can be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be necessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person was exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration and heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from simple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.   > some >had itchy skin or rashes.   People respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends upon what it is about the compound that ""pisses off"" their body. Pollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many people, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an histamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard, causing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an allergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that contain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can perturb that persons system as much as inhaling it.   >More serious accusations include respiration  >difficulty   See above. And dont think that heart rate changes, and circulatory problems are not serious. They can be deadly.  and brain damage.   The area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system controlling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling the cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin, and other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.   >Now here is a new>suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food poisoning.   Absolutely.

(And there are plenty of other examples.) >Can you reconcile this?  The problem you see here is that some Christians claim things about the Bible which they dont actually believe or practice. Ive known all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the  conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I dont know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).  The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact  that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane  and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this  (other passages as well) arent directly applicable today would  show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they  actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doenst.  While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians, I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this case, making claims about the Bible which the claimants dont actually put into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as ""Word of God"", ""inerrant"", ""infallibale"", ""The Manufacturers Handbook"", ""The only rule of faith and practice in the church today"" to describe the Bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speakers words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks ""Where are you?"" and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had answered Gods words he would have said something like ""Im here in this tree."" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use.  I hope this helps. --                                                                      ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w--- | Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ",1,soc.religion.christian

For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain (humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food, packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects.  Read Olneys review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his* sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.                      --Dianne Murray    wcsbeau@ccs.carleton.ca  ",3,sci.med

" I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed. Steve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci.  Med. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women  poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did  not exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I  see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.    Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have  no idea how the human body interacts with its environment and how that  balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians  who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go  from doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and  then when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling  quack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldnt help Elaine or Jon but somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a  quack.    Ive been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten  years now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were  raised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their  farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to  entering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is  about 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition  either tune me out or just stop coming to class.  Thats okay because I  know that some of what Im teaching is going to stick and there will be at  least a few ""enlightened"" physicians practicing in the U.S.  Its really  too bad that most U.S. medical schools dont cover nutrition because if  they did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the  medical profession.  In animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with ""good"" bacteria after  antibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not  have a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with ""good"" bacteria is  needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all  kinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small  and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are  nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune  system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike  the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce  toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of  these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up  residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this  happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier. Steve got real upset with Elaines doctor because he was using anti-fungals  and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  Elaines doctor a quack.  Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly  called, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible for this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a  yeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis. Candidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it  requires that the host immune system be severly depressed.    Candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of  normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral  course of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain  much higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in  its food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely  survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In  diabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little  buggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but  some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  the candida or not isnt certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on  the skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to ""treat"" it. If its internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  nondiscript.     Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system  ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless  they broach the mucus membrane ""barrier"".  If they do, an inflammatory  response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A  from their diets.  About 30% of all Americans die with less Vitamin A than  they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin  A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane  barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong  inflammatory response after a candida bloom.    While diabetics can suffer from a candida ""bloom"" the  most common cause of  this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which  knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main  competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are  available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not  use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of  the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus  inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum  antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate  just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring  vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.  But even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by  the excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to  return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of  the problem is addressed(lack of a ""good"" bacterial flora in the body and/or  poor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective  therapy for candida overgrowth.  From its name, it is an acid loving  organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not  grow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is  the predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum  antibiotics).    In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to  minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.    If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the  bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology  occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool  for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first  place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong  but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan  has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool  specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of  false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant  basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes its nice to know that I dont have  colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a  doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  Candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria  tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline  during a womans period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina.  Vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal  problems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of  Lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of  the purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina  problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year  until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting  scripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had  the same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some  digging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she  used in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex  returned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  patients is a non-existent syndrome.  The nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria  which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.   If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through  aresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes. But before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system  needs to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and  some of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans  are not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of  the population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent  disorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).   Some of the above material was obtained from ""Natural Healing"" by Mark  Bricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human  nutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in  the future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely  important role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in  the body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida  blooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate  intake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI  system is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, its not going to out  grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and  fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check  once carbohydrate is returned to the gut.  If Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post,  fine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably  accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctors use of vitamin  A and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice  from newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our  time and knowledge can slug it out to our hearts content.  If you saved  your venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly  seeking help alone, I wouldnt have a problem with your behavior.

"          My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas carols is about the limit for them. Thus Ive never really believed in God and heaven, although I dont actually believe that they dont exist either - Im sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess.         Lately Ive been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but Im not used to believing things without proof - just as I cant believe that there definitely isnt a God, so I cant definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.          Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions dont?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isnt there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if theyre not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??          Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??          I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and Loving my neighbour for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.          Finally, what is Gods attitude to people like me, who dont quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly good people. Surely not believing doesnt make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.          Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. Im sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin. 50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging. That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year, but I think this is as close to a wash as youre likely to find.  I personally dont care much for Alomars defense.  I dont think hes nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he cant turn the DP to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming I cant overlook.  In the long term, Id move Alomar to another position.  If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, Ill be Alomar could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think Id rather have Jeff Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.     --  *   Gary Huckabay   * ""You think thats loud enough, a$$hole?""           * *   ""Movie Rights   * ""Well, if youre having trouble hearing it, sir,   * *   available thru  *  Id be happy to turn it up for you.

" I havent been following the previous HRs.  But there are two, that I saw live that would have to be up there (up where? there!).   1) Rick Mondays HR to bury the Expos in the NL championship in 1981. It was hit off Steve Rogers, who is a RHP and primarily a starter. Why was he used as a reliever when the Spos had Reardon and BillLee warming up in the bullpen.  Considering Monday couldnt touch LHP, Lee would have been a safe bet.  He wasnt even doing any drugs at that time (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into  Montreal.  The blast wasnt the important aspect.  It was the timing. Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th.

" Hi everyone,  	   Im a commited Christian that is battling with a problem.  I know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying You fools, do you still think that just believing is enough?  Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith. But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to him (i.e. doesnt know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who knows and believes in God but doesnt make any attempt to live by the bible.  Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do) as taught in Romans, but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being spat-out  Can anyone help me, this really bothers me.

"    someone wrote in expressing concern about getting AIDS from acupuncture    needles.....  Unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who                themselves has AIDS..it is unlikely (not impossible) they will get AIDS          from acupuncture needles. Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant  involved with acupuncture needle insertion.   Most acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They       do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of  diseases via this route...so its good business to advertise ""disposable needlesused here."" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however,  being poorly manufactured and too ""sharp"" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                         If I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get  their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.       The risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly  use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong               patient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates  this risk. Better quality needles tend to ""slide"" past vessels and             nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                         Acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all  solid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into  meridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require  the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be  injected into the body as it would  be in a typical ""shot."" when the skin is  puntured. On the other hand when the solid  acupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to ""squeeze"" the needle  from the tip to the level of insertion such that any cooties that  havent been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain  on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior.   Of course in TCM...the bodys exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory  and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture  site.   While Im fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease  transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for  what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.    Speaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center, the above behavior is completely inappropriate.

It is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of its posted hours, but what you describe is misbehavior. Ask to speak to the clinic director, and complain.

Hi Janet,  Sounds exactly like mine.  Same circumstance, same onset symptoms,  same cafergot uselessness, same duration.  In fact, of all the people I know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches, that I generally dont bother sharing what Ive learned about mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.  I dont think its heat, per se (Ive had more in winter than summer). Dehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up before playing rather than after.  Being in shape doesnt seem to help me much, either.  Ive identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in  descending order of importance):  1) Heavy exercise 2) Sleep deprivation 3) Fasting		(e.g., skipped breakfast) 4) Physical trauma	(e.g., head bonk)  Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I  dont get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of  the other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered  this, Ive been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two  or three years when I get cocky (""Its been so long, maybe I just dont  get them anymore"") and stop being careful.  Hope this is helpful.  John. ",3,sci.med

Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the dealer. Hes been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on what hes seen and heard from his customers.   Saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles,  fully refunded if you dont use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or so, based on the 6 year treasury rates.

This suggestion isnt as far-fetched as it sounds.  Years ago in another time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, youd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.  So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient container.

When James speaks of  justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring the believing sinner innocent in His sight (Pauls use of the word).  Instead he is speaking of the sinners profession of faith being  ""justified"" or ""proven"" by the display of good works. Also according  to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a ""dead"" or  ""useless"" faith which fails to save.  James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it is teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward  salvation, but as evidence of true faith.

"  	I am a good Catholic boy. A convert no less, attracted by the rational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity [in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I never had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and do, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with miracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the Bible as Gods sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue that the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as Gods revelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the Church that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant ludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance of Luthers right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked. 	But recently I read Peter Browns _Body and Society_. It is very well researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting questions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than todays carzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body,  totally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings.  	now the question isweird, but weve got used to them, or did the pristine ""Fall of the Church"" happen within one generation. It certainly didnt have to wait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so, wha does  this say about Gods promise to always support the Church. Its no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church not being an organization at me. Its a community or it is nothing, and it was the early communities that were weird. The institional church was a model of sanity by comparison. 	I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to this entirely serious issue. Im not sure it is an issue for Protestants with their ""soul alone with Jesus"" approach, but for we who see the ""ecclesia"" as a ""koinoia"" over time and space, the weird early Christians are a problem.  [This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants have a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  ""The soul alone with God"" is certainly important for Protestants, but its by no means the whole story.  I have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out, Protestants dont have quite the same problem you do, because we believe that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant mythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or more likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion, starting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated power during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept the theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including such items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of Reformers such as Luther and Calvin, youll find Church Fathers such as Augustine quoted all the time.  I think youll find many Protestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was ""wierd"".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I dont much want to talk about in this context, since its been looked at recently -- thats the question of whether one can really think of Augustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views on Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to Protestant thought.)  One thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology. There are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We see every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think theres good reason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than that.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think theres good reason to think that many Christians were happily married.  I cant help suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and sane people that we do now.  I think theres also a certain level of ""revisionism"" active in history at the moment.  I dont mean that theyre manufacturing things out of whole cloth.  But dont you think there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel?  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

Here again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the biblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the modern sense.  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburgs work  _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Romhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either.  Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isnt broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly, I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts before this which mention the tomb).        >  > Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body.

" A reply to a post by kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu (aka Nancys Sweetheart):   ?Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted ?in very limited circumstances.  I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something so materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess anything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were discussing the ""mind"" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal, as it were; and half spiritual.   ?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the ?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do ?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of ?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didnt say.  We interpret this passage ?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.

It is by necessity the infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,           Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.   ?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain ?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they ?cannot be certain.  This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.   ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?""If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

I dont think ""extra-scientific"" is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  Extra-rational is a better phrase.  In fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.  For example, Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a friends crank theory of chemical action.  The friend was wrong, but Pasteurs discovery stood.  A prior investigator (Mitscherlich), looking at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he lacked Pasteurs motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric (now we Again, Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the ""Newton of mirror-image life,"" which he never admitted publically.  Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes.  Avery started this work because of one of his students, and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian, defended Fred Griffiths discoveries in mice. Most of Griffiths critics were French, which decided the issue for the student.  Avery told him to replicate Griffiths work in vitro, which the student eventually did, whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery (Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, JEM 1944). --  Mark A.

" I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  Just after I completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training day and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale, and lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasnt that heavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few  minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But I dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued arm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either.  Ill take it easy for the rest of the day.  My arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal -- my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold.   Horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain.  Im 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise regimen.  So that cant be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the bar cause these symptoms (I hope)?  Has this happened to anyone else? Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.  Does it come with age?  Thanks, Tom --  Tom Molnar Unix Systems Group, University of Toronto Computing & Communications. ",3,sci.med

" I prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be.  I believe that automatics should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise would not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy. More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery instead of concentrating on the road.  The manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something, granted it isnt a large movement.  Plus, driving should be FUN!  Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore. 	In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster that any human could move a stick.  If I was racing, Id want and automatic.  For normal driving go with the manual.

The way they were used at that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league. Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1 through October 1; while they didnt play substantially more games than the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that stretch.  ----- Eric Smith erics@netcom.com erics@infoserv.com CI$: 70262,3610 ",2,rec.sport.baseball

I havent had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering that I was expecting the worst from them!

" OFM responds to a query about reference    [Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an    introduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible    courses.

I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Youngs NT    introduction...  Two other Intros to The ""Introduction"" byThe references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but the book contains a wealth of information.  Perrin and Dulings Intro is also very good.  Its somewhat more modern thanauthors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order of composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the development of the NT.     ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the    best recommendation these days would be Harpers Bible Commentary.

The Seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits  for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.   The actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed  unsafe under federal air quality laws.        ""People with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to  exacerbate that inflammation,"" said Joel Schwartz, Ph.D., of the Environmental  Protection Agency, who was the lead author of the study.  ""When people are on  the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over  the edge.""       The Seattle Study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits  with daily levels of PM,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter  of 10 microns or less.  These finer particles are considered hazardous because  they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of  compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10  exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.        In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at  levels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30  microgram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with  asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.        The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory  Disease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung  Associations medical section.        The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that  particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study  by Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles  may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.   Other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms  and bronchitis in children.        ""Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,""  says Dr. Schwartz.  ""But more and more research is showing that particles are  bad actors as well.""      One problem in setting, standards for particulate  air pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated  pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex  and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  acid aerosols.        ""Researchers cant Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects  of particulate air pollution,"" says Dr. Schwartz.  ""We have no way of  duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  "" Consequently, most of what  is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research  like the Seattle study.        Given that the EPAs current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur  dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any  time soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with  asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.      ""In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only  cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and thats  rarely particulate matter,"" says Dr.  Schwartz.  ""However, PM10 doesnt have  to be near its violation range to be unhealthy.""

Following 2 days of  presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel  weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement.    Among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a  distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins;  (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential  for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical  excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and  extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4)  patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high  risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely;  (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for  melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education  and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality  from melanoma.

Within the program, there are four types  of cancerin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on  clinical research; ""comprehensive"" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a  multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community  outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer  prevention and control research.    Although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was  the National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new  cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage  of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened  the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and  cancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers program grew  progressively.    In 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today,  there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria  for comprehensive status.    To attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an  institution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly  established in 1990, the eight criteria for ""comprehensiveness"" include the  requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in  several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong  program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings  into clinical practice.    Moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly  beyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also  referred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting  the infrastructure of a cancer centers operations.  These criteria encompass  strong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials,  significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important  outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of  sources.    The other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and  capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit  important new findings or address timely research questions.

These centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers  engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators  and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications  from new discoveries in the laboratory.    Clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and  clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently  incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their  overall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today.    Finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely  structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and  control research.  These centers interface with state and local public health  departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention  and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions  responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.   Consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with  institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community  hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials.    Together, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward  creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through  interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the  laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

The  decision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to  test a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of  Health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and   Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the  therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies  including Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH  that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is  intended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the   replication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last weeks  reports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Armys test of the  MicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.   ""The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the  next 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,"" said Shalala.    Administration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine  Healy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had  convinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested  simultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of  multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two  years.  ==================================================================       HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  ""The Limits of AZTs Impact on HIV"" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol.  114, No. 14, P. 18        AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was  approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.   Burroughs Wellcome,  the manufacturer of AZT, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the  drug.  However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that  although HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk  of  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit   disappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of  the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the  drugs cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  Even though U.S.  researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than American trials,  many argue the European  researchers suggestion that HIV-positive patients  experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of   AIDS symptoms.

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers!)  Ive been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs.  Im female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions Ive been sexually harrassed at this company.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.  Im really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.  There was no note.  I do not know if it 	- someones idea of an innocent joke, that went awry 	- someones sick idea of flirting 	- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)  I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question, I dont know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.  I can lock up my desk, but I cant lock up every book I have in the office.  I cant trust that someone wont shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when Im not looking so that I go home to find such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body.  To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for leaving wasto the lunch.  So I returned atperson had already left for lunch.  They left atcould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer.  I need some prayers --- I cant stop crying. I am so deeply wounded that its ridiculous.  I feel like Im some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel like Im a sub-human piece of garbage thats not worthy of a simple phone call saying ""Were leaving for Marys lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive.

Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isnt tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company do me no good when Im terrified or healing from the latest assault.)  And please pray that I dont turn into an automaton because of this.

This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts dont come into my head and stay there, triggering depression.  Please pray that this latest trauma doesnt come between me and God. In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God, and its also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesnt drop me from his loving hand, but its awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think Im falling and forget that Gods still holding on to me.)

Perhaps youd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them, Im making them too) but I think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the  business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesnt make any basic  assumptions that arent the same as any other discipline of scientific research.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than  ""the old Newtonian model of the world"".  And I doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical ""world view"".  Psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending.   >It is also important to distinguish reason from science.

In the meantime, some folk will  have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.   Theres nothing at all surprising about this, its the way the gathering of knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own  discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base, even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people wont have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had  a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and  tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research cant seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a  creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.    Again, I think it gets down to defining what you mean by ""science"".  I often dont recognize what it is that I do, and am involved in, in the way science is portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  They portray science as a collection of immutable facts, pronouncements of TRUTH in big gold letters.  Thats silly.

Ive debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous.

"  Hello all.  We are doing a bible study (at my college) on Revelations.  We have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable interpretation.  We are now on chapters 17 and 18 which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of Babylon.  I believe the beast is the Antichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church.  What are some views on this interpretation?  Is the falling Babylon in chapter 18 the same Babylon in as in chapter 17?  The Catholic church? Hate to step on toes. thanks  --------  Jimmy BuddenbergMuskingum College   [Reading this imagery as the Roman Catholic Church was certainly common in earlier Protestant writers.  A lot of us find that frankly embarassing now, though some of our readers will certainly advocate such a position.  The problem is that the description makes it look a lot like a political entity.  Its associated with kings, controls world commerce, is seated on seven mountains (is traditionally regarded as built on seven hills).  If its a church, then its not the current Roman Catholic church, but a church that has been taken over by the anti-Christ and merged with the state, turning into something rather different than it is now.  Presumably in such a scenario the true Catholics are among those who are persecuted.  Given the overall impression that Satan is pretending to be an angel of light, and the true church is a persecuted remnant, I think the most consistent playing out of the image would be that the anti-Christ would be presiding over a church that claims to be the heir of both the Protestant and Catholic traditions, but that the true spiritual descendants of both Peter and the Reformers are equally being persecuted.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

There are other animals on this planet with advanced 	mental facilities which have not developed ""religion"" as a 	satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?  	Further, it appears that only humans have a ""need"" to explain the 	unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet, 	including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly 	content in their ignorance.  	Id like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me 	from your unsupported statement.  They	*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need 	not be researched; 3) religion was ""made up"" by humans to address a 	perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that 	is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical 	structure with biology at the apex).  	Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the 	underlying presuppositions.  >Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  >because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life >a safety blanked to hide behind.  ""Oh wow..all i have to do is  >follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness."" >For all of you ""found jeezus"" , how many of you were ""on the brink?""  	I disagree that Christianity is ""an infectious cult"".  It has 	certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in 	spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia. 	That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is 	""infectious"" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides 	a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this 	is the case).  	I disagree that Christianity is ""a safety blanket"" which supplants 	hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one 	Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a 	Christians source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to 	you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose 	and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of 	control over ones own life the problem or is it something else?  	Finally, one does not appropriate ""eternal happiness"" by following 	Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance 	of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people 	from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the 	Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian 	in the Person of Gods Spirit.  	Heaven is one of two final states that 	Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally 	not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this 	promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived 	benefits to them in the here-and-now.  >but i digress...

Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a 	priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this 	as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate 	priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word, 	convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum). 	Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting 	the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits 	of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful 	that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask 	""Why?""  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom- 	plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it 	does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian 	is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of 	friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot 	evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or 	harm others if the sole purpose of being a ""friend"" is to gain a 	conversion).  	As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep- 	ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a ""hurry-up"" 	attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no 	conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was 	coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open 	to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now). 	The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings 	conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part 	(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.  >We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we >die.        	We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die 	just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more 	than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is 	so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find 	a more expansive view.  	(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing 	arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language 	of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so? 	How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social 	structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)  >Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG.

(please, if i am mistinterpreting, correct me.)  however, i have witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by staying in a marriage, and that the problems were due to personal childhood issues that had never been resolved.  i ask you, is divorce justified in such a case?  they knew who they were, what they were doing, they were deeply in love, but in the end, it did not work out. i must admit that i dont see jesus forcing them to live together, or even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else later on.  opinions?  vera ******************************************************************************* I am your CLOCK!     |  I bind unto myself today    | Vera Noyes I am your religion!  |  the strong name of the	    | noye@midway.uchicago.edu I own you!	     |  Trinity....		    | no disclaimer -- what 	- Lard	     |	- St. Patricks Breastplate | is there to disclaim? *******************************************************************************  [This is a commonly discussed question, though its been long enough that Ill allow it to be asked.  As you might expect, there is a range of answers.  Catholics and some others will say that divorce is never justified.  (By the way, in situations where someone is being abused, or for other serious cause, separation is allowed by all traditions that I know.  No one should be forced to stay in a situation where they are in danger.)  Others see it as a last resort in situations that have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is to choose the lesser of evils.  In some sense the difficult legal question turns out not to be divorce, but remarriage.  Thats because of Jesus statement in Markthings, this turns on your approach to the Bible.  Conservative Protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions. More liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where a literal interpretation would lead to painful results.  (It is noted that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost on a whim.  Thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is that Jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing, not to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be exceptions.)  Catholics, as is typical with Catholic ethics, take a theoretical hard line, but allow for exceptions in practice through the process of anullment.  In the last discussion most of our non-Catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that in some cases there might be no good alternative, but there was a feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that come up during it, and that in a properly run church, divorce should not be necessary.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian
" Wharf Wrat >They were designed for speeds of upwards of 80 - I forget the >exact spec - but for military vehicles.  Thats 80 in a 1958 Dodge  >Powerwagon.  Not 80 in a 1993 Ford Taurus.  Ever once in a while, you still see a reference to the super- slab system as ""Interstate and Defense Highways.""  But whether the military has much of anything that goes 80 on the road is another matter.  A few of their most whomped-up diesel trucks, maybe, load permitting.  The military surplus stuff Ive driven -- ""Jeep Classic"" (Willys/Kaiser/AMC, pre-independent suspension) and Power Wagons (Slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup) werent exactly congenial at highway speeds, and I wouldnt swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi.  You just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at least the one they used to use.  Designed circa WW II as a compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity on sharp rocks and so forth, its quite ill-adapted to high speeds on civilian roadways.  For those who cant remember what they look like, imagine a mountain-bike tire with a road rib in the middle, scaled up to car size. Oh, yeah, and narrow too. One of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus  Jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of the advancements made in ride and handling since D-Day.  But the point made by Wharfie and others stillyoure going to do 80 in a mil-spec 58 Power Wagon (or a Jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired vehicle) anywhere, Id suggest the American interstate.   Your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car and skills, road maintenance, and the swarms of fools around you; the roads were designed for going like the devil.  Naturally, neither I nor my employer advocates unsafe or unlawful driving.  --Joe ""Just another personal opinion from the Peoples Republic of Berkeley"" ",0,rec.autos

On of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they should not be spoken of in a ""common manner"" or ""trampled under feet"" such as the Lords name is today.  The ceremonies are performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside as being as sacred/holy/uncommon place.  We believe that the  ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they are viewed with the right spirit- which in this case is in the temple.

Interesting.  Where there is no divine imperative of course we must establish rules of operation.  But we cannot be as creative with what God has explicitly spoken on.

The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly its not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 TimothyAll Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  GalationsFor I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man,  nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the  sameare not interpreting Scripture as you read, theres probably nothing  I can say to change your mind.  But I think its naive to think that  our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.  > Also, based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges > people if they follow him (see Acts> those who reject Jesus teachings are judged by the very words he spoke > (see John> interpretation, nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word > if it had to be interpreted.

"  Ive been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained about the old ballyard place. Sure, its been cold, the food lines were long, and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique. Or so I thought.  I went to Tuesdays game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the Stick was  a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but  everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are CLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite.   The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence are very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top of the fence and give a great view, and theyve got beer stands at the bottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic  old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.  These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real  businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out. Just  like he used to tell his checkers, ""If the customers dont come back, I dont need as many checkers"". This isnt a knock on Bob Lurie - he was a competent businessman but he didnt deal much with the general public.  Ill give an example of how the level of service has changed. The onion  dispenser jammed as I was using it. An attendant came over, apoligized for the problem and proceeded to fix the machine. After he was done, he cleaned the machine and said he was glad to be able to help. In the old days, there was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say ""Go to the stand 100 feet away - they might be able to help"".

E.G.things, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so much there is no ingredient but water left.stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  Such systems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental and not related to the theory.  The only exception is probably herbalism, because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants that have active and useful substances.  But that isnt what  is meant by alternative medicine, usually.  If you get into the Qi, accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.  Perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the Rhine experience.

"       Philadelphia at     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader. ""What could be better,"" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs are challenging?      ""Its pitching, its always been pitching that weve lacked,"" announced Ryne Sandberg.  ""If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - well know we might be able to win.      ""Lord, I hope we pull it off.""      The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.      Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a gap in right-center.  ""Cool Papa"" Bells speed allowed him to cut the ball off and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone grounded out to second, ending the threat.        ""Teams are starting to realize that you dont have to pitch to Schmidt or Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells Rose at first), and its a credit to the Phillies that theyve been able to sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.""  So came the analysis from Frank Chance.      The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas grounder moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it 3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs, Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense. He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.      Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.      Sundays twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would conclude their series with the Expos on Monday. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st      Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday. The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they arent among the all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of first in this wacky season.      Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2 Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday. The Cards captured Mondays game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve Rogers 3-2.  ""Were really good against ground ball pitchers because of our team speed,"" remarked Lou Brock.  ""I dont see why we cant win this division.""      The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first. -------------------------------------------------------------------      New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs, now 2 back - but in 4th!     ""When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a pitchers park like this,"" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith Hernandez added that ""their defense takes away quite a few runs per year, and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.""  The Pirates have made only 26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.      Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the .500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins, and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go. ------------------------------------------------------------------      San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5):      Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting pitching that just wouldnt tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw, ""once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.""      Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves park had been a homer haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13. Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sundays doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the National League record.  They were still a tad behind the 61 Yankees pace. They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.      In the doubleheader, the Braves Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score. The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely. -------------------------------------------------------------------      San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the trade looked even better.  McGriffs batting average was even rising.  Of course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.      Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after 10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home, and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them. -------------------------------------------------------------------      Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):      Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  ""Normally,"" Drysdale remarked, ""I would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I cant afford to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we cant afford to let the Astros beat us.""  He then winked andDavis will get decked once.""      The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of the nastness of the Astros park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away, with center field at 420 feet.  ""Its as if some three-year-old threw a tantrum and told hishome runs,"" remarked Roy Campanella.      The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway, Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings, according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the Astros didnt score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent. Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.      ""I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,"" he explained.      ""How can we do that,"" Pee Wee Reese wondered.      ""Theyre going to be beating the ball down, so weve got to be ready to throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  Well go with a shallow infield almost the whole time.""      The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.      ""Were mostly a power team,"" remarked Ron Cey.  ""Jackie and, when he plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other plays can do it now and then.  Were sunk in a place like the Astrodome.

Anything which affects the physical world can be studied.  For example, since we are part of the physical world, anything (including spirits) which affects our behaviour can be observed.

The purpose of science is to produce a model of the *physical* world.  The model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome of future observations.  One of the aims of experiments is to carry out well defined observations which are objective.  Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world, and the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions.  At the moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a *spiritual* world.  As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions it should be the currently accepted models.  The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the correct ones, whereas many religions claim to represent the truth.  The arrogance of many theists is that they claim to represent the truth, this cannot be said of scientists.

" In response to a lot of email Ive gotten, I need to clarify my position.  I am not in favor of paganism.  I am not in favor of the Easter Bunny or other non-Christian aspects of Easter as presently celebrated.  (Incidentally, Easter eggs are not non-Christian; they are a way of ending the Lenten fast.)  My point was to distinguish between   (1) intentionally worshipping a pagan deity, and   (2) doing something which may once have had pagan associations, but nowadays is not understood or intended as such.  Many people who are doing (2) are being accused of (1).  It would be illogical to claim that one is ""really"" worshipping a pagan deity without knowing it.  Worship is a matter of intention. One cannot worship without knowing that one is doing so. --  :-  Michael A.

" Dear fellow netters,  From time to time a term like Oneness Pentecostals (or something similar) has occurred in posts to this group. I also know that there is a movement called something like Jesus alone.   I believe in the Trinity and have no plans to change that, but reently I was made aware that there is at least one person within our church who holds the view that there is no trinity. In the near future we will discuss this item, and I feel that I shall ask you, my friends on this group, for background information.  Can anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there is only Jesus? And vice I shall appreciate both quotes from the Bible and historical development.  Thank you all.

The Ack man is apparently an alien life-form, much like the pod people from planet Mars, who can take on any form (the ability remains the same, however). The Ack-people have been spotted on many teams to date, but it appears that the Orioles staff (mentioned above) and the Expos bullpen (Barnes, Walton, Fassero, Gardiner and Rojas) have been the prime target. Apparently John Wetteland was roughed up by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his system rejected the takeover, and has been on the DL ever since. Contact the authorities! This evil plot must be stopped! (the Ack-people can keep Jack Morris and Juan Guzman, though.

" I heard third-hand (not the best form of information) that there was recently published results of a study on Multiple-Personality-Disorder Syndrome patients revealing some interesting clues that the root cause of allergy may have a psychological trigger or basis.  What I heard about this study was that in one personality, a MPDS patient exhibited no observable or clinical signs of inhalant allergy (scratch tests were used, according to what I heard), while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms, including testing a full ++++ on scratch tests for particular inhalants.  If this is true, it is truly fascinating.  But, Id like to know if this study was ever done, and if so, what the study really showed, and where the study is published.  Any help out there?

Those are the arguments against Lopez for the >Braves for this year.  But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle- of-the-road prospect. Hes the real thing. NOW.   Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for Greenville, or Richmond, its good enough for Atlanta. If he really was awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.  >Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid >abilities to call games, to work with the pitchers, to throw out >runners.

The kid *will* improve playing at AAA, and >he probably wont being a reserve with the big club.    Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players. Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really arent very good at baseball. Think of it as ""TWG"" without the caps. Its a losing strategy to say, ""We have solid guys, we dont need to improve."" You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.  Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon Berryhill arent exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years, Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference, IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.  ""Two big bats."" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gants trend disturbing. Call it one and a maybe. The Braves platoon is OK, but neither player has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH are awful. Ill leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, Ill retrace Mr. Likhanis midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA. (Got that, Mike?)  And doesnt Cox call pitches, anyway?  >goodness.

" for SRC  In most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning ""Passover."" In English, German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term.  One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUMAnglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply ""Spring Festival.""  However, Bedes is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in ""Die Sprach,"" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as ""hebdomada alba"" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as ""albae."" Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of ""alba,"" meaning ""dawn."" They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for ""dawn."" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.   Yours,  James Kiefer   [No, Im not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety of celebrating Easter.  However this seems like it contains enough interesting information that people might like to see it.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian
" Rex (REXLEX@fnal.fnal.gov) >It is also of interest to note that in 1825, on the occasion of a jubilee, Pope >Leo the 12th had a medallion cast with his own image on one side and on >the other side, the Church of Rome symbolized as a ""Woman, holding in >her left hand a cross, and in her right a cup with legend around her, >Sedet super universum,  The whole world is her seat.""  	You read more into the medal than it is worth.  The Woman is the Church.  Catholics have always called our Church ""Holy Mother Church"" and our ""Mother.""  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who wrote in 251 AD, ""Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have the Church for his mother?"" 	Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup, which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His Blood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that ""This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you and for many."" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant and holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the Catholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout the world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, ""From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation, for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.""  And so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote ""For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lords death until he comes."" (1 Corinthians 11.26)  	You are quite right about the identification of ""Babylon the Great, Mother of all Harlots"" with Rome.  I think we simply disagree as to what time period of Rome the Apostle John is talking about.  Andy Byler ",1,soc.religion.christian

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the > person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  First by his fruits.  The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiahs teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and Gods providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the Worlds religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesusfor another"".

Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  Gods restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, Gods representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  > [Mark> or Look, there he is! do not believe it.  ... > Mark> great power and glory.   > My understanding of Jesus answer is that, unlike his first coming, > which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  > By the way, from Koreshs public statement its not so clear to me > that he is claiming to be Christ.

Well, I think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word (also, ""extra-scientific"", etc.).  Nor am I prepared to give a general account of rationality.  In terms of examples, there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a ""surprising"" experiment is, what counts as ""surprising"", etc. The same may be said about ""logical grounds"".  My point is that quite frequently (perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples such as Toricellis Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his ""sea of air"" hypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) ""surprising""? Well, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed) out of ""perfectly rational grounds""?  Well, there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit. The novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty at the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it ""new""?  Well, one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you like. --  Gary H.

I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style ""values-free"" methods, that teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make ""choices"", actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in ""contraceptive technology"" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.    Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why dont we teach ""safe drug use"" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isnt it because we know that a class in ""how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs"" would increase drug use?  Why isnt ""drug abstinence education"" barred from schools because it teaches ""religion""?  Arent we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?   --  Joe Kellett jkellett@netcom.com ",1,soc.religion.christian

" Here is a press release from the Natural Resources Defense Council.   New Data Show About 100 Major U.S. Water Supplies Vulnerable To Milwaukee-Type Disease Outbreak          of the Natural Resources Defense Council     WASHINGTON, April 14  -- Internal EPA data released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council reveals that about 100 large water systems -- serving cities from Boston to San Francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting Milwaukee.    The EPA list is attached.    ""These internal EPA documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many American cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration,"" said Erik Olson, a senior attorney with NRDC.  ""Water contamination isnt just a problem in Bangladesh, its also a problem in Bozeman and Boston.""    ""As of June 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on EPAs list probably will be breaking the law.  The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution,"" Olson continued.  Some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the laws deadline.    Olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities.  A 1991 survey of 66 U.S. surface water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent of raw water samples contained the Milwaukee organism cryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite called giardia.    Adding to the level of concern, a General Accounting Office study released today by House Health and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Henry Waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nations system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems.    ""This new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of Americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink.  We must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public,"" Olson noted.  ""The time has come for many of the nations water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink.""

If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that yesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to be reading this was there for it and remembers that it happened. But *proof*? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere. You need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that you remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything you clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you hallucinated the whole thing.  To talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the terms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the resurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.  I think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is ever disproved. I also think that this will not happen, as the evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things go. It is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take the resurrection on faith. There are reasons to believe it that appeal to the mind, too. ",1,soc.religion.christian

Good point -- it is very true that these ""false"" predictions are dangerous--we are warned (more than once) in scripture about false prophtets.  	However, as is often the case with other issues, one cannot let those who falsly report such ""visions"" as a reason against believing in any of them (I did not get the impression you were asserting this, by the way...I consider my response not so much a response to your posting but a response to the topic as a whole). 	Among other things, she predicted the conversion of Russia to Atheism 	(something that happened less than a year later w/ the Bolshevik 	revolution).  She also predicted the second world war (that is, predicte	predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope, who 	was not the current one.  It happened just like she said.)  	She warned there would be ""fire in the sky"" as a warning that the  	second world war was about to start.  About a week before Germany 	invaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, from 	England to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacular 	reddish color in the sky ever recorded.  To this day some try to  	explain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Marys 	prediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.  	Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all 	over the world and persecute religion.    	She said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.  Every 	single one has been realized.  	One can only use the term ""coincidence"" 	so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes  	ridiculous.    	SO...yes, there are many false prophets and many false reports. There 	are true ones, too.  We must always remain open to that.  Fatima was 	one example.  There is another one, currently occuring--the  	apparitions that have been taking place at Medjurgorje, Yugoslavia 	(or whatever its called now).  Mary has been appearing every day for 	eleven years now.  Its time the world started listening.  	More info available to any who want it.

"  I was watching the Dodgers/Marlins game yesterday and a couple of things impressed me.    First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer atmosphere in early spring for baseball.  In comparison Wrigley Field in early April still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and bundled up fans.    The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals! I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball. It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to the Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the AFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it, but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with a lot of baseball fans in other cities.    Baseball certainly needs a charge and I hope these two expansion teams bring back some excitement.  Well find out Friday how Denver Bronco fans respond.   Phillies are 2-0!

If you reject the claims of Jesus, and still go to    heaven, then the jokes on me. If you reject him and go to hell,    thats no joke, but it will be final.

" In article <ls8lnvINNrtb@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu      (Russell Turpin)>            ...  >*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does* >imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are >incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and >which are not.)  To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So theres a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other hand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  ""You people call THIS science?""   (My opinion, for what its worth, is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)    Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation.  I dont believe it is  ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.     My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this is true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.  Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before the twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later  mathematicians did prove them, of course.)    I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and whats not  as it is a  matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of  incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to  objectively convince others of the validity of ones results is an essential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step  of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward  that goal then one is not doing science.)  When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation.    In article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that > science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?    Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable amount of effort in a ""serious scholarly investigation"" such as I suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately  specific question to try and answer.    The ""science"" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science  currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.   I certainly wasnt thinking of some idealized science or the mere use  of ""reason and observation.""  One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.    Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with the study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there  is any existing research related to this question.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.     lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet ",3,sci.med

Interesting statements, simply because I have been told otherwise.  Im certainly not questioning Steves claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I agree that foods dont bring on the recurrence of Crohns.  But inflammation can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.  Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough caveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically, the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be realized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds of inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem. Therefore, anything that doesnt digest completely by the point of common inflammation should be avoided.  With what Ive been told is typical Crohns, of the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting Completely out - never again -	o corn (kernel husk doesnt digest ... most of us know this :-) 	o popcorn (same) 	o dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins 	o nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)  Discouraged	o raw vegetables (too fibrous) 	o wheat and raw grain breads 	o exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since its apparently mostly water) 	o greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...) 	o little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arbys without it!) 	o long grain and wild rice (husky) 	o beans (youll generate enough gas alone without them!) 	o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing  I was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this day and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your system as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try the ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If its bad, dont do it again! Remember though that this was while I was in remission.  Fordaylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think its cooks more thoroughly - youre mileage may vary.  As with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Dont just take my word.  But this is the info Ive been given, and it may be a starting point for discussion.  Good luck!  -Spenser   --  S.

The difference between the two is merely  cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we wont begin to approach the glory of God.   The power we are being given is a test, and I am sure that in many cases we will use our new abilities unwisely.  But, people have been using sexuality unwisely for millenia and I havent heard an outcry to abolish it yet!   No matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we arent impinging on Gods power.

Unfortunately, the workmanship is quite disappointing. On BOTH cars, the rubber seals around the window and door fell off. It turns out the seals are just big grooved rubber band. It goes on just by pressing the groove against the tongue on the door frame. Surely it would come off easily.

" Bob Van Cleef    If the Papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the     Pope cannot ""be wrong!""  If, on the other hand, this is not a matter     of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the    Pope is the legal head of the church.     In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice    but to obey.  This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is more or less heresy.  You might call it ""infallibilism"".  Its the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does. This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.  The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.  A couple historical examples come to mind.  Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there. This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!  Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages. He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didnt quite get around to defining it.  Now theres no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine.  The Popes doctrine was criticised by many in the Church. He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the Church.  If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism.  The teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a Pope must be resisted if they are to the detriment of the Catholic Faith. A Popes authority is given for the purpose of building up the Catholic Church.  Commands in conflict with this purpose have no legal *or* moral force. ",1,soc.religion.christian

While I dont read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..  I bought a 93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude,  and Celica.  Check this months Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.    MyI thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they dont have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.   I didnt like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was ""ok"" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didnt have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but thats it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so its too early to see its reliability so far.  For what its worth, my MyShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have ""stuck"" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesnt drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesnt like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assemblystitched properly.

As you can see, Im primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesnt have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasnt changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probes suspension doesnt like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  Theyll find that they have no room in the back and youll find that the car rides differently (if thats ""better"" is up to you).  Also, theres a lot of glass around you which I wasnt expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  Ive heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system werent available when I got the car so I cant comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldnt want this car in theinevitable surprise potholes, tires arent meant for snow, and the seats assume that youre not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is muchgenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but theyre rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CDs max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth ""pouch"" but thats it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, dont store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

" I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show, and would like to  hear your comments.  MILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of this product really impressive, if it didnt cheat.  The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor is powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction.  The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.  Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was  added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of torque.   Here is the goodyou still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.  They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz bottle is $25.  I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was so little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didnt believe it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against my common sense.  Has anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real? If you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the  second floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.  Jason Chen  ",0,rec.autos
" Larry L. Overacker writes, responding to    I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the    net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in    schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But thats really beside    the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?    Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as    provided for in canon law.  Heres some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPXs ""schism""; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my 1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someones compliance or refusal and then say whether they are ""obedient"" or ""disobedient"".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they arent being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them ""disobedient"".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And theres thecommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where theyre wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, theyre wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... lets move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But its a superset, so it doesnt work the other wayschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests dont comply with the Holy Fathers desires doesnt make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must adddecent reference on Catholic theology, and thats what youllthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Heres what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for     ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this     character it must include besides the trangression of the commands     of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.     (from the CE article ""Schism"")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clearday.  And thats all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to isconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Fathers motu proprio ""Ecclesia Dei"", you can find out.  Its the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  Its not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  Its from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... theres no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other 1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvres problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine ""Si Si No No"".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Popes jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this isconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power ofconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The ""Si Si No No"" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so cant tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Popes thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. Theres no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, heres the passage in     The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete     and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does     not take sufficiently into the account the living character of     Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,          comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the         help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into         the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes         about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and         study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.         It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which         they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who         have received, along with their right of succession in the         espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.      But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which     opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the     Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to     remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond     with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ     himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.      (Papal motu proprio ""Ecclesia Dei"", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvres concerns in detail.  What is John Paul IIs stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I dont know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey ""justified disobedience"" or even ""obeying God rather than man"". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying todo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  Its one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  Its something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian
" Julie, it is a really trying situation that you have described.  My brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad (although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room with nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out underneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  You would like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hash things out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and possibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would   have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really dont understand where youre coming from.)    reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that we did this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for this was ....)    dont accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!)    find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really are decorational and functional at the same time.)    Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some gunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.    The relationship really can work.  Its just a matter of keeping things smooth and even.  Its sort of like making a peace treaty between warringcompromise.  Breaks can be taken, but communication between everyone involved must continue if the relationships here are to survive.  Joe Fisher ",1,soc.religion.christian

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the > person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they are wrong.  I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the right chapter, anyway it is close and I dont have a Bible at work to check with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later he will be with them.  He said something along the lines of ""I will be in you and you will be in me.""  (Again I cannot provide the exact quote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that the Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward event, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him. If you look for a person you will be deceived.  It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would be a political or military leader and so didnt recognize Jesus when he came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth. A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over the world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like what the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasnt like that and I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.  Oh and by the way, I dont expect it to happen once.  There is no one Second Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ comes into someones heart, Christ has come again.

The result, which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period.  That was their argument to prove that you dont go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.  	Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more in initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra on repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things.

" In article <Apr.20.03.03.06.1993.3836@geneva.rutgers.edu> shellgate!llo@uu4.psi.com (Larry L. Overacker)    You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  Im not trying to be    contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction    and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?    What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that    Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?    This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically    stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Popedeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I dont view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.     It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is    disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over    authority and discipline.    The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  Its basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  Im reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayers clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.     My question to the supporters of SSPX is 	 Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms 	 could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that 	 the Popes position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX 	 dont jointly make such  choice.)     If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.    If I adopt the view that ""Im NOT wrong, I CANT be wrong, and    theres NO WAY Ill change my mind, YOU must change yours"", that    Ive either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesnt go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!     We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the ""real""    traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter    East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isnt the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.     I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow    error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`    I may be wrong here, Im not Roman Catholic. :-)  Thats heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that its pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, thats what usually happens during a majorsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.     What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement    regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how    do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?    Again, Im not trying to be contentions, Im trying to understand.    Since Im Orthodox, Ive got no real vested interest in the outcome,    one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?     It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the    Popes commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.  Not really; start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last 300 years.  Everything is very well spelled out.  The West excels at critical thought, remember?  Thats what Catholic theologians have been busy at for centuries. ",1,soc.religion.christian

" Several recent posts have identified the English word Easter with the Babylonian goddess Ishtar.  Easter is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with Ishtar. If Easter and Ishtar were related, their history would show it. But in Old English, Easter was Eostre, cognate with English East and German Ost.   The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is Austron. Not until after 1400 did Easter have a high front vowel like Ishtar. Clearly, the two words have quite separate origins.  There may be neo-pagans who worship Ishtar at Easter, but if so, they are making either a mistake of etymology, or a deliberate play on words.  -- Michael Covington  (Ph.D., linguistics)    --  :-  Michael A.

" I consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer.  The design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an EEPROM.  The idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM.  The secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used. The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect at a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable.  This was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in operation.  The case, of course, might not be the same for your 1993 RX-7!  The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated.  Since steering angle and velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers use of the car.  I am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ECM.  While it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style, it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars.

"  	Ive heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life and ministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event. (About 40 years or so). Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay?? I know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose un-important, but I still cant help be curious!  --------------------------------------------------- Ivan Thomas Barr   Contact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk  [The Gospels arent dated, so we can only guess.  Lukes prolog is about the only thing we have from the author describing his process. The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do some investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that say a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are debates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly dont have the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them seriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peters sermons, and was written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die. One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words may have been made earlier than the current Gospels.    In the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred to hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe even from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather than from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a period when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do think there was some written material earlier, which was probably used as sources for the existing Gospels.  Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to confess that Im not sure how much reliance Id put on the methods used.  But its common to think that Mark was written first, around 64 AD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the Century.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the other.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

" Jon Ogden (jono@mac-ak-24.rtsg.mot.com): It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions : prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  A good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews says that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated through his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).  Reading Abrahams ``biography in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil Gods promise on Gods behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didnt evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of  faith in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed Gods promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.

This is a lovely area for anecdotes, but I am sure you are on to something. As a physician, I almost never getis going around, I either dont get it at all or get a very mild case.

Pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness, and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam!  I think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantly exposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that later on, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us, so we deal with it well and get a mild illness.

You need to ask yourself some difficult1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the ""new age movement"" teach or does he require Gods help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their lifes writings, so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.

Well, Christ referred to God as ""My Father"", not ""My Mother"", and while the ""maleness"" of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women -  english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).

John Dominic Crossan (Professor of Religion at De Paul Univ)- _The Cross That Spoke_ Harper and Row Pub. 1988, Also his latest work  _The Historical Jesus - The Life of A Mediterranean Jewish Peasant_ Harper and Row Pub. 1991,  Also two works of Burton Mack (Professor of New Testament at the Claremont Graduate School) _A Myth of Innocence_ Fortress Press 1988, And his latest book _The LostHarper and Row, 1992.  You might start with Macks book on Q and then  examine the others afterward.  However I think that once you do that you will see that your ""evidence"" is not as sturdy as youd like.  Most of the tired arguements you stated, assume eyewitness accounts, such is not the case. But Anyway look at Mack and Crossan and then get back to us.  randy ",1,soc.religion.christian

" Disclaimer -- This is for fun.  In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called ""stolen hits"", defined as a play made that ""an average fielder would not make with average effort.""  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), Ive figured out some defensive stats for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays Kurt Stillwell would not have made.""  OK, I realize thats unfair.  Kurts probably the victim of pitching staff, fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But lets put it thisreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurts 57.6% out making ability, how many extra hits would go by?  To try and correlate it to reality a little more, Ive calculated Net Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league average fielder would make.  By the same method Ive calculated Net Double Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).  Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player. I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which should represent the players total contribution to the team.  So dont take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this article.  The short version -- definition of terms HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.

I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points. However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more.   IMHO  Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.  Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are (in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingmans (probably by quite a bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I think it deserves some consideration.  Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.  Darrell Evans - No.  Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingmans both the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfields). Just think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.  Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.  |>  |>      Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody |> giving |>  |> Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by todays standards, |> marginal. |>  |> Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount dont belong there. Theyre both |>  |> shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal. |>   Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have shattered Aarons home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers). Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.  |>      Lets be a little more selective, huh?

When |>  |> certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential |>  |> candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to |>  |> the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan? |>   Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone making a case for him.   Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might bring up his name.  Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately.  Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I dont know I did not hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers - even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL the possible votes.  So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying dont belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.  Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan Maybe - Murray and L. Smith No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman  As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.

" Kevin Mitchells sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated  pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over  New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started  with a solid single to right, moved to second on ""Bob"" Kellys infield sneaker down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Bransons well-placed bunt--a  rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.  Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only  given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who  argued plate umpire Kelloggs inside strike by ""drawing the line"" (really, he should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting tossed.  The Mets fifth started with a Howard Johnsons first-pitch homer.  Pugh must  have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kents single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundleys grounder to the drawn-in Branson failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called itThompson was hung out to dry after Pughs first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended. (Isnt the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)  The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkins ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.  Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game in late August last year when Bonillas three-run dinger slapped a loss on Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cincis season.  Bonilla ended up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a  week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though Im a bit surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  Ill take it, though.  The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory today.

The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text.  Lukes account is highly suspect (I would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Lukes account is written at least 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established. Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in  Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts.   What we need, therefore, is a reliable text, critically appreciated, which documents the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection.

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues. The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example, was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign. His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so and then rebound.  Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had good numbers immediately.  I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it didnt hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching well initially, though I dont have stats handy.

I cannot see any good reason why the ""why"" >= questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the >= supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is >= as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.  I beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models. Scientific models are a game to play, and are only as good as the assumptions and measurements (if any) that go into them.  As an example, I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in atmospheric science.  It wasnt long after Sagans admonitions that one of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of the nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume that the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one- dimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds blow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed a transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they were generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation between the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness from reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagans model showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model  in sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to our boys model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in the winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer. He predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry, the biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would probably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even less than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.  To quote from H.S. Yoder,  	The postulated models have become accepted as the reality 	instead of the lattice of assumptions they are. 	Authoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical 	analysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticism 	of the model approach to earth problems is warranted because 	many key parameters have not been included.  This statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.  Only when convincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results may one suggest that the model may describe the reality.

"   I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway.   About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes  under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement  of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of  the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced  the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor   suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.   While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being   manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently  increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (  palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part  the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had  been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the  pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is   persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3  and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides  minor reductions in pain and is only short term.     My questions      Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the      levels of pain?       Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?       Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?     Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.         Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.

On the other hand, some people  seem to start tuning out `the same old words and pay attention better  when things get changed around.  I think innovative priests and liturgy  committees are trying to get our attention and make things more  meaningful for us.  It drives me crazy too.   Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My  local parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish  over.  Sometimes we dont have the option of attending a Mass in the  style which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to ""just offer  it up"" probably is the solution.  A related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is  that spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like  innovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual  needs without just going our separate ways.

They believe the danger is real, but others may not.   Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning  others of the danger? Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs  are correct, and all others are false?  Some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance, and behave in an  arrogant manner, but that is a personal idiocyncracy. It does not  necessarily mean that they are all arrogant.   ============================================================ Steve Hayes, Department of Missiology & Editorial Department Univ. of South Africa, P.O.

" Pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup.  I would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as Im sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us.  Now, the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist.  That would normally be a non-issue with me, but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which I guess it is, according to his faith).  This is a great strain to our friendship.  I would have no problem if the subject didnt come up, but when it does, the discussion quickly begins to offend both ofbecause I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended by what I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such circular arguments as the Bible is Gods word because He tells us in the Bible that it is so.  So my question is, how can I convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great friendship?  How do I convince him that I am beyond saving so he wont try?

"   A friend of mine has been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis, as a result of trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago.  The psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not.  Ansaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) worked pretty well for three years but isnt helping much now.  My friend is now taking Meclomen (another NSAID) but this isnt helping control the pain at all.  In the past two months my friend has also started taking Azulfadine along with the NSAID medicines, but the effects of the combined drugs arent supposed to be realized for several months.  As a result of the pain, my friend is having problems sleeping.  Staying in one position too long is an ordeal.  Another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed (left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm; bottom of feet; shoulders and outer thighs).  The tendonitis is quite painful yet my friends doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it.  The latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is now recommending Prednisone.  The hope is that the Prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis.  My friend is a 41 year old male who feels like hes 80 (his words, not mine).   If anyone is aware of any new treatments for Psoriatic Arthritis, alternative courses of action, support groups or literature on it, I would be extremely grateful if you could e-mail to me.  If anyone is interested, Ill post a summary to this newsgroup.  thanks in advance, Donna dmp@fig.citib.com ",3,sci.med

New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.    but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.    computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.    able to handle it?    in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best    learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, dont speed.)    Detailed    Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics    car while cornering near the `limit (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less,     or `understeer) or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, wont get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical    will develop what are called `slip angles; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.   than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.   braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.   three   declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as   (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.   slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?   2) almost never.     In more   in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didnt, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobiles transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    cars envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they dont tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.   to his freshman physics textbook, and that you cant ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what hes talking about?    2) in more   textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless youre a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, dont worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.

" Boy, hats off to any Cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put down Braves fans.  I mean, all the Braves have done is gone to two consecutive world series.  Also, being the Cubs fan that I am, I really have to hand it to all the Braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that infernal cheer that they have.    However, I do have to protest anyone saying that all Cubs fans are stupid.  The way I see it, either Im just too stupid to acknowledge it, or that observation was just plain wrong.  You might have us confused with Bear fans. ;)  Anyway, about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the Cubs would finish up last in their division.  (Even behind Florida?!?  Sheesh!)   These same people were predicting the Braves to clean up in their respective division.  Well,  were ten games into the season and these people are a little less vocal now.  I wonder why.  Well, the way I see it, the East is up for grabs, and whoever wants it most is going to take it, with the exception of Florida.  Every team seems to have good batting and pitching, with Philly presently leading the pack.  But, I just have to point out, if the Cubs do take the East, theyll do it without the benefit of a competent manager.  However, and it pains me to say it, the pennant is going to go to the West.

"  	A ""new Christian"" wrote that he was new to the faith and  learning about it ""by reading the Bible, of course"". I am not at all sure this is the best path to follow. 	While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the  revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this revalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one denommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just reading the Bible. 	This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although I would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the Book of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are comfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really sturdy, somewhere in Chronicles. 	The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith of Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned - the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church organization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the lived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one hopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading. 	Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I  would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the christian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading GrahamManley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greenes _Monsignor Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian, but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly, I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after reading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being a Christian is allsome way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by the person of Jesus Christ.

No, there is something called the ""Delany Amendment"" which makes carcinogenic food additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the 1950s, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.  This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are very weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they are banned.  This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember a time back in the 1960s when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good, and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned. This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.  If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone would do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicates that enforcement is still in effect.  An odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as ""gumbo file"". This is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  This is not only a natural product, but a natural product still in its natural form, so maybe thats how they evade Delany.  Or maybe a special exemption was made, to appease powerful Louisiana Democrats. ",3,sci.med

If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No, the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so  monologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesnt seem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree) there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc) But my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution we have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e. emperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human  torches to light up his dinner party it wasnt because the believe in a  risen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just cannot stand up to critical examination.  randy   ",1,soc.religion.christian

Ive heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?  On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless. To date Ive driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift.  My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window, I lightly press the accelerator & try agian. Ive found that clutchless shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5.   krispy ",0,rec.autos

The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance hes comfortable with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesdays night game, he was  clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because hes changed his stance so much.  Im also a bit concerned that because hes got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting all the homeruns, hell become competitive, swing even harder and screw himself up even worse.

As I understand, these are all short term.  I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are  every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start. Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of  disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it is worth.    I treat patients with UC and Crohns.  An educated patient is a good  patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things can be put in context.

" Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial      when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or      will he assume the superstition of his parents      when questioning?   Ive often found it to be the case that the theist      will stick to some kind of superstition when      wondering about God and his scriptures.  Ive      seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,      and the other theists alike.  All assume that      their mothers and fathers were right in the      aspect that a god exists, and with that belief      search for their god.       Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or      aspects of the same religion, but overall the      majority keep to the belief that some ""Creator""      was behind the universes existence.  Ive      known Muslims who were once Christians and vice      versa, Ive known Christians who were once      Jewish and vice versa, and Ive even known      Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout      their transition from one faith to another,      theyve kept this belief in some form of higher      ""being.""  Why?       It usually all has to do with how the child is      brought up.  From the time he is born, the      theist is brought up with the notion of the      ""truth"" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,      the Torah, the Quran, & etc.  He is told      of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in      the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.      He is also told that to question this (as      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime      against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-      tures truth is to damn ones soul to Hell.      Thus, by the time he is able to read the      scripture for himself, the belief in its ""truth""      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a      matter of course.       But it doesnt stop there.  Once the child is able      to read for himself, there is an endeavor to      inculcate the child the ""right"" readings of      scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant      readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to      explain away the unexplainable with ""mystery.""      Circular arguments, ""self-evdent"" facts and      ""truths,"" unreasoning belief, and fear of      hell is the meat of religion the child must eat      of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath      of some sort, and the child must learn to put      away his brain when the matter concerns God.      All of this has some considerable effect on the      child, so that when he becomes an adult, the       superstitions hes been taught are nearly      impossible to remove.       All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can      truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,      Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.      Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that      God *does* exist and look at everything from      a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most      theists can somewhat, especially when presented      with ""mythical gods"" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,      & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption      of Gods existence and question it impartially?

As it says in 1 JohnThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this requires work on our part.  As for the quote in James, Satan doesnt care what we believe.  What matters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in what one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to oneself about believing in the first place.    Stan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by obligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how many times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when doing Gods work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we should do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel Jesus presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to Timothy in 2 Timothyout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.""  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothythem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers."" So, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are correct first.  Remember Jesus warning in Matthewhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be a disciple completely in both thought and deed.    Joe Fisher   ",1,soc.religion.christian

Simply avoiding > mistakes doesnt get you anywhere.    I think that Lee Lady and I are talking at cross purposes. Above, Lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps.  In most of this thread, I have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not.   Lee Lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between Einstein and the average post-doc physicist is the quality of their thought.  But what is the difference between Einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy?  (Some would give Velikovsky or Korzybski as examples.  If you dont like these, choose your own.)  I say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi.  Both Einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong. Both Velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this.    Let me approach this from a second direction.  When one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference, there are many kinds of criticism that one can make.  One kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed.  Another kind of criticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either not important or not interesting.  The first difference is the one that I have been pointing to.  The second difference is the one that Lee Lady seems to be discussing.   > If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit > to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. > But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This > is where you and I disagree with Turpin.    I have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered  scientific, what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims, not just of some of its proposed remedies.  Similarly, I suspect that traditional Chinese medicine has many remedies that work; what it lacks (as one example) is any experiment that tests the presence of qi.  > ... In order to have science, one must have a theoretical > structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically > validated random hypotheses.  Certainly a ""theoretical structure that makes sense"" is the goal. In areas where we do not yet have this, I see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses.  Lets facealways wait for an Einstein to come along and make everything clear for us.

Anyway...)  	The basis for our (the catholic churchs) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles  and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their   preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently  considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.  	Hope this helps--I would welcome anyone who has more information to 	add to what Ive said. 					- Mike Walker 					  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu 					  (Univ. of Illinois) 					  ] ",1,soc.religion.christian

Can anybody name a player who was rushed to the majors (lets, for arguments sake, define ""rushed"" as brought up to the majors for more than a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  Im serious; I tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but Id like to look at players for whom this theory didnt work, if there are any.  Id prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can look up their minor league stats.  (Its important to distinguish between players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).    Lets kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", although there doesnt seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job, and has been there ever since.  Its really hard for me to see where he would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being ""rushed""; Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have been less likely to give up on him.  Yes, if you bring a player up early, hes likely going to struggle.  But does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts performing up to expectations?

Basically, they looked  at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they were 24, and noticed some interesting things.     For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players careers lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also   found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc.     It was the most impressive thing Ive seen on ESPN in recent memory.

Having a lot of experience with a 92 Grand Am coupe, I can firmly state that they do have a lot of outstanding qualities.  Very reliable throughout.  Great layout of controls and components.  Very roomy considering the exterior size of the car.  They  look sharp inside and out.  The V6 that I drive has exceptional power and  drivability compared to other similar cars that I have driven.  All in all, its a fun-to-drive, dependable, and reasonably priced vehicle. Please dont knock it with a statement like that unless you back it up with specific reasons why you feel that way.

" This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to _Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was ""a beautiful black queen.""  This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled ""Was Cleopatra Black?""  (The answer to the title is ""no""-- she was greek.)  I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in Wash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and down the Mediterranean.  (Also, if what I remember is correct, the ""Black Madonna"" doesnt represent a person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe Buehler....?)  In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus, the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians, or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about the Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then there are the Ethiopians....  Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are ""white"" (i.e., of the racists ""race"").  If I may risk a potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other, I dont think that this ""Jesus was white"" thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did.  Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to ones own racial group. --  C.

(John Keeping Christs commandments is a ""work"" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him.  Also,  6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and findcumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung9 And if it bear fruit,down. (Luke Again,  16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit shouldwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit.  What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out.  If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really dont have any faith.  Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important.  Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith, true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs commands are actions, and if we dont do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree.   It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really dont have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test.  Words and talk mean nothing.  I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but this should be sufficient.  Hope it helped.

Perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all testified that the BATF shot first, they they did not identify themselves before tossing in concussion grenades (not that anyone inside could have _heard_ such identification after being near a concussion grenade) and the announcement from the BATF that they have sealed the warrant under which they were operating - which was a _search_ warrant, by the way, _not_ an arrest warrant.

What is the mechanism and why would a physician >call for chest xrays to diagnose the cause of the clubbing?  Purists often distinguish between ""true"" clubbing and ""pseudo"" clubbing, the difference being that with ""true"" clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip). With ""pseudo"" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then negative, which is the normal situation. ""Real"" internists can talk for hours about clubbing. Im limited to a couple of minutes.  Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only ""true"" clubbing is associated with disease. The problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is very reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the  congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization.   The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally.   Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however, the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.  -km ",3,sci.med

"   The Chevrolet brothers were respected racers & test drivers for the Buick Co. when Durant was there.  When the directors kicked Durant out of GM in 1910 he took Chevrolet and others with him.  As mentioned before, they founded the successful Chevrolet company.  A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM! That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!  After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure. (If you look at the organization chart for GM in Sloans book, Chevy division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the ""passenger car division"" which covers Buick, Olds, Cadillac, and Oakland/Pontiac)  -Jeff Hagen    (minor deity of worthless auto-trivia)  hagenjd@ac.wfu.edu ",0,rec.autos

Could it be caused by a >nervous breakdown? >  Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive _Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).    OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.    Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having  recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.   The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather than being from an external source.  Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing, or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety.  In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships.  Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions.  The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .  						kind regards,  						todd +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | Todd I.

The concept of a closed canon would >certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets.  On the other hand, >an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes. >  Lets get back to basics.  Canon (from the latin) means a rule.  If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken.   There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation Id say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)  >Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new >but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call >that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldnt that be more having to do with >knowledge?  I know, the gift of knowledge may not be as exciting to >talk about, but shouldnt we call a horse a horse? >  I agree with the problem of confusion.  If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word of the form ""the man you live with is not your husband"" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.

" Just had the opportunity to watch this flick on A&E -- some 15 years since I saw it last.    I was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film for handling infectious diseases (and similar toxic substances). Clearly they ""faked"" a lot of the computer & robotic technology; certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction itself, let alone the idea of a ""space germ"".    Quite coincidentally [actually this is what got me wanted to see the movie again] I watched a segment on the otherwise awful _Howd They Do That?_ dealing with a disease researcher at the CDCs top lab.  There was description of the elaborate security measures taken so that building will never be ""cracked"" so to speak by man or nature (short of deliberate bombing from the air, perhaps).  And the researchers used ""spacesuits"" similar to that in the film.  Im curious what people think about this film -- short of ""silly"". Is such a facility technically feasible today?

Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON""T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.  Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving, LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them? Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines? No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.  I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine. Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that  when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350 engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about $2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again, you never need a tune-up.  If youre looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, Id say you got a great deal. Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.  Good luck. ",0,rec.autos

"   The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to death, but I havent seen anything in rsb yet.  Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt, reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.  Now Ive seen the replay several times and I have concluded that Darryl missed the ball, and that the fans glove was essentially behind Darryls.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as soon as he realized he had made the catch.  That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game, Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a tirade about how the fans are stupid and they dont care about  winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made the catch.  Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any  that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is impossible.  Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first nine games.  I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play, he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.  But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities of the fan.    --	The Beastmaster    --  Mark Singer     mss@netcom.com ",2,rec.sport.baseball

If you can get  your friends physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for  the RDs services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The  better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friends  plan doesnt, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to  control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal. Crohns disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and  lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but  Im not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  For  bad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effects  are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.

They are just responding in their naturalOops, that is not a recognized ""illness"" in the psychological community, better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)  Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system, just e-mail me and Ill send a summary file to you).  In the general population, NTs comprise only about 12% of the population, but among physicians it is much much higher (I dont know the exact percentage - any help here a.p.p.ers?)  One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious choleric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are also extroverted, they are best described as ""Field Marshalls"".  This trait is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge, to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically- minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However, when the NT person has self-image challenges, the ""dark-side"" of this personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.  A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling), and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  Ive known many M.D.s of this temperament and suffice to say I dont oblige them with a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).  Maybe we need more NF doctors.  :^)  Enough on this subject - lets move on to candida bloom.   >Let me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have  >no idea how the human body interacts with its environment and how that  >balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics...

Lets all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent.   >...Humans have all  >kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small  >and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.

In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune stressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged. I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks of Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (wont get into the details), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENTs made this diagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you understand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal therapy below).   The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being considered systemic in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween infection.   >Steve got real upset with Elaines doctor because he was using anti-fungals  >and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what  >vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling  >Elaines doctor a quack.  I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after my blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then dropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained (hes one of those evil orthomolecular specialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal, he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin) supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene. Call me carrot face.  :^)  Hopefully, Elaines doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to all supplements.  Im even reevaluating some supplements Im taking, for example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.   >survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides  >the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In   Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that I definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my sinuses, I still want to ask thedemonstrate candida ""blooms"" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on Sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered normal).  BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, cant remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950s which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious) aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms.  Ill have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion.   >some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus  >membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to  >the candida or not isnt certain.  My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic response to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive. Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a  threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to Candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane irritation due to the bodys allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post, one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a  Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.  BTW, and Ill repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, ""Sinus Survival"", has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic sinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it doesnt cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  Hes also found that nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.  This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit, lots of ifs, and implies, which doesnt please the hard-core NT who has to have the double-blind study or its a non-issue, but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.   >If its internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty  >nondescript.    This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until the appropriate studies are done.  And that is if you cant observe or culture the yeast ""bloom"" in the gut or sinus, then theres no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.  Its a real Catch-22.  Anotherno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if its not up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which should not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets, you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get funding (as a scientist at a National Lab, Im very aware of this for the smaller funded projects).  Im afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other doctors got together, pooled their practices case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.  It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds its a done issue -  excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will not, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...   >Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in  >the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the  >vaginal tract which compete with it for food.

Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus species can grow hyphae (""roots"") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing in bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but you cant kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such as Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor Ive been in e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long- term treatment of GI tract ""candidiasis"".  Its like trying to weed a garden by cutting off whats above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away.  The $60000 question is whether a contained candida ""bloom"" can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming ""systemic"" in the classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal.   >In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good  >reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very  >favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and  >humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.

Also, if one is an anal retentive, like Ive been diagnosed in a prior post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)   >If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even  >blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.

When I finally find a  >doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.  As Ive said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies dont work. For example, I went to three ENTs, who all said that I will just have to live with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the abs failed (they did mention surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia werent plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and fairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and equalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly improved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated. Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ENTs I saw who said that Id just have to ""live with it"".  Im confident I will reach what one could call a total ""cure"".  The anti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of abs for the last four years.  (having sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above. Be sure to get the revised edition.)   >...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic  >GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his  >patients is a non-existent syndrome.  Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his visits to several ENTs totally floored him when they said ""youll just have to live with it"".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now shares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road to recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice.  Im sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti- ""yeast hypothesis"" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as, ""its worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases"", to put it mildly. I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient.  Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the ""hypothetical yeast overgrowth"" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues have been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things - you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients, shouldnt you at least sit up and take notice? Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldnt work.  Im afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with ""scientific correctness"" that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which we dont see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having exhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help, so I did the naturalwent to a couple of doctors who are (somewhat) outside this establishment, and as a result I have found significant relief.  Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt) therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective?  Id like to hear a doctor tell""well, Ive tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country, and since they clearly dont work for you, I now have the authority to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I cant promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies, and Ill have to register your case at the State Board.""  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I wouldve jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the patient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine, and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient - that its doing everything it can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all (true quackery).

"if you think it of general interest.  Here is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may find it relevant.  A listmember  > What makes common-law marriages wrong?  A common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is nothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by a preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings.  There is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the West) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage, and that the clergyman is there only as a witness.  HOWEVER!  The essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife, forsaking all others, till death do them part.        The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be clear about whether a commitment has been made.  Suppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows, etc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live together.       After a year or so, the man says to thewas great while it lasted, but I think its time to move on.       She      Heyounger.       She      He      Shewe first made love.

Heman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that. You mustnt take them literally.  And that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public record.       The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other things) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom, if anybody, and vice versa.       The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with property rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom.       Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they dont want their daughters seduced and abandoned.       Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment, or just ""poetry.""       And persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.        Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when Christians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching about marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married in a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage vow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly used in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it. Try to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that the probate judges interpretation of them is not at all what you intended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether ""You are my main squeeze"" and ""I am here for the long haul"" do in fact cover the same territory as ""forsaking all others"" and ""till death do us part.""        This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic that hasnt?) One listmember was asking, ""If a couple love each other and are living together, isnt that marriage in the eyes of God?"" Eventually someone asked, ""In that case, what is their status if they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce? Are they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk out on? "" The original questionerof that!"" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says, ""We dont need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other,"" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of bother.  At this point someone may say, ""None of this applies to me and my mate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment, for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death us do part. So in our case, no ceremony is needed.""      To this my reply wouldlicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence of dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly makes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.  Back to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around 20 years. HeAt what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? Iexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for better or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted such an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?   Yours,  James Kiefer ",1,soc.religion.christian

Hmmm... people in the americas before the time of Christ, children who die young, etc. ?   >  Of course, the next step is, ""I dont believe in Hell either, so why will I >be there?""  It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God.      But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.   >Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and never >see God--so they do, in fact, believe that theyre going to Hell.     I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond  bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe theyre going to hell. They believe theyre going to _die_. Understand that youve turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are going to Hell. Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals dont have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesnt change the fact that theyre going to Hell (die a final death))     I dont claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence.  (assuming I go to Hell and not to Heaven) In other words, Ill never know Im dead. Hmmm...    >  Hell doesnt have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because its eternal,      Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has ""At least shes not suffering any more; Shes in Heaven now."" ?      Consider the following ""At least shes not suffering any more; Shes in Hell now.""      The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell,  it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering.  Granted, they wouldnt be *anything* (wouldnt be having any conscious experience whatsoever).       You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning  to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort  of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.       Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (""Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?"" Its my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.     >and its a lot worse than Heaven.  Thats the only comparison that matters.      That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and  an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven.  ""Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?"" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, ""Well what good is your Heaven if theres no hunting? Scram."" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no  immortality).    >Alan Terlep				    ""Incestuous vituperousness"" >Oakland University, Rochester, MI			 >atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu				   --Melissa Eggertsen >Rushing in where angels fear to tread.

Ive attempted to come to terms with it previously >(in an attempt to understand it for learning purposes) and havent been able >to grasp the reasoning.  > It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus. As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.) Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin, she didnt have original sin.  When science discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.  Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She  refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old  would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.  RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.  Joe Moore ",1,soc.religion.christian

Most of the other models are in the same class, but arent the first cars you would think of. I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats.  I didnt include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots.  The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si Nissan NX1600/NX2000 Mazda MX-3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT   If you look at the prices of these cars, theyre more expensive than theyre 4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and trend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600/NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one) Stylus -> Impulse/Storm  To illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at around $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now, you might be saying that the Tercel doesnt offer the power that some 4-doors offer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Lets take anotherIsuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a 1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive. Again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more money for this type of car.     In short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence ""less"" car, its market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan (SL1/SL2) version.  I hope this clears things up a bit......   Mihir Shah 	  ",0,rec.autos

The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded ""impact"" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Dont bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.  -Scott O.

In v. 4 he stated that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.  He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it plain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but those who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he was an Israelite in 2 Cor.who belong to Christ are Abrahams seed, and heirs to all the promises given to the Israelites.  The promises come with the law.

" In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and doctrines.  That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying that they are infallible.  Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will probably agree.  In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved, there is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing ""There is no way out of the loop.""   Someone called `REXLEX has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but he did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism.  As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where ityou dislike them.  `REXLEX >  I disagree with Dr Nancys Sweeties conclusion because if it is > taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  However, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX has written does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does not like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.   *  There were two sentences in `REXLEXs post that seemed relevant to the point at >  There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be > experienced and it is verifiable.  I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I have, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I dont claim to be infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I do claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.  However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier article.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances.   >  It is only because of Gods own revelation that we can be absolute > about a thing.  But how far does that get you?  Once Gods revelation stops, and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  For example, lets suppose that our modern Bible translations include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said, exactly, ""This is my body.""  Well presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didnt say.  We interpret this passage using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know that our brains are notis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?  So, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is that Jesus said ""This is my body.""  Beyond that, once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we get into trouble.  Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they cannot be certain.    That is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know that human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not believe we are infallible, any more than we do.  When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying to cover them up.  I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only ""very confident"" of.  For example, we might say that we know our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But other things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical thinking, should not be labled asvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.  But, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.   *  `REXLEX suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didnt think very highly of it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though, so dont let my opinion stop you from reading it.  If someone is interested in my opinion, Id suggest _On Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.

Now this is getting interesting!  I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the resurrection in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this 1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was  pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the ""great judgement"" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my ""soul"" (which, by the way, I dont believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms  that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people ""sleep"" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that Im omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different ""technology"" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I dont think most people claim to know the details.  I dont think Id say its the same atoms.  Id assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldnt expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  Id suspect that its in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

" [With Franks permission, I have added some information here (and in one case changed the order of his contributions) in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views.  My comments are based primarily on William Ruschs historical summary in ""The Trinitarian Controversy"", Fortress.  Im going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]  MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY   [SECOND CENTURY  The writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much of the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides, Athenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the ""Apologists"".  Their theology has often been described as ""Logos theology"".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less a two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the Father, as his mind or thought.  This ""immanent Word"" became ""expressed"" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus. Thus Jesus full distinction from the Father only became visible in history, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity. Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated, because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the Godhead.  Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as one personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation (the ""economy"").  The distinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus views should probably be called ""economic trinitarianism"", though that term is normally used (as below) to refer to later developments.   THIRD CENTURY  --clh]  Dynamic MonarchianismPerception of Godsand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are consubstantial with the Fathers divine essence only as impersonal attributes. The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict sense of the word. Perception of Godsimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The diversity of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to a hypostatic union. Asignation of Deity/without beginning or end.a unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.  Holyis ascribed to the Holy Spirit. Criticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation. [In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism at all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the Church.  --clh]    Modalistic Monarchianism(Jesus Only) Perception of Godsqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This essence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself. Perception of Godsand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of Gods modalistic manifesting of himself. The paradox of a subsisting ""three in oneness"" is refuted by recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama. Asignation of Deity/the only unique and unitary Godmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).  Holyone God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification. Criticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian deficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christs baptism. [Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are actually two slightly different groupsfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme. Sabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately, information about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]   [Ive moved the following description to be with the other third-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]  ""Economic"" TrinitarianismPerception of GodsSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical, indivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption. Perception of Godsby means of such terms as ""distinction"" and ""distribution"" dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division. Asignation of Deity/The equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the Godhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication. Criticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the Trinity. [Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as mentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in substance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]  [Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted to apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms of the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a mediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality of creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is ""eternally generated"".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is eternal.  It cannot be said that ""there was once when he was not"" (a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son is intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described as separate ""hypostases"", though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is one of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios (""of the same substance"").  The Holy Spirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father through the Son.  Origens intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but he pushes things in the direction of separateness.   FOURTH CENTURY  --clh]  Subordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]Majorcults Perception of Godsidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence. Perception of Godsconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. ""Threeness in oneness"" is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God. Asignation of Deity/he is not of the divine essence.  Holyas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him. Criticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology. [Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully human either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this view from adoptionism.  --clh]   Orthodox TrinitarianismAquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity Perception of Godsone essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co- eternal. Perception of Godsthree modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists ""undivided in divided persons."" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead. Asignation of Deity/In its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function. Criticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thoughtineffable mystery of ""three in oneness."" [At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all of which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which are somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond to Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origens thought a bit too far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general the East tended to take an approach based on Origens, and it was hard to get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was based on the work of Athanasius with theGregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three, they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council of Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]  Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

His equivalent average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level of play.  That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesnt make the top ten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave Winfields .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds, an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what Mattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years; just ahead of Time Raines five-year average; better than Ryan Kleskos MLEs.   He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting. That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best hitter in the majors.  Clay D. ",2,rec.sport.baseball

I also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily > specify that ""this is how it happened"", but proposes a likely description of > the phenomena in question.  Am I mistaken with this understanding?  Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.   The correct word is likely. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be true in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere best fits for the data.   > = But if you claim that there must be > = an answer to ""how"" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from  > = ""nothing"", science has some good candidates for an answer.  > All of which require something we Christians readily admit Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.   > The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive.   > With out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith.  This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.   Yes, I know that one cant believe without Gods help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. Im afraid this does not change my situation.   > [ a couple of paragraphs deleted.> universe exist"" ]   > = I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely > =  > = 1) Why is there existence?

No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.   Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also""why nothing exists in nothingness"".   Now, ""why anything exists"" is equivalent to ""why something exists in somethingness"".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.  > I might add, the worldview of ""Things that exist do, and things that > dont...dont"" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable, > as does the theists belief in God.

I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question ""why this, and not that"", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human beings existence.  > We come to this. Either ""I am, therefore I am."", or ""I am for a reason.""  This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.   If I am for a reason, Ive yet failed to see what it would be.  From our perspective, it looks like I exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?  > If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are > satisfied, and need not a doctor.

No, it doesnt, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.  > I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer ""why"".   It > appears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is > inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting > that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer.    It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question  ""why do I exist, in particular"" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I cant just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.   > My apologies.  I was using why as ""why did this come to be"".  Why did > pre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.  I think ""pre-existence"" is an oxymoron. There is no time outside of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that  perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.   > But we come to the admission that science fails to answer ""Why?"".  Because > it cant be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the > question invalid?  No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?  > M. Pihko does present a good point though.

Will it be shaken by the > production of evidence that shatters our ""sacred cows"" or will we seek to > understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and > continues to say) in his Word?  This is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous other questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base my faith on.

" Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in general and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around 1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luthers rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend ""to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.""  It adds that ""not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.""Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Popes authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We dont even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.""  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishops critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled ""Penalties for Specific Offenses"" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with ""Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church"" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of ""Penalties for Specific Offenses"" which is entitled ""Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise"" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, whichthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.""  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to imagine a more authoritative opinion. The Cardinal     The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not     in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with     offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses     against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are     apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a     pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the     exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the     consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh     Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated     he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because     there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishops lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful     In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June     appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also     papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist ""obstinancies."" And from the     eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to     present the Archbishops act of grave disobedience as an offense     against the Faith!  It is said--today--that Mgr. Lefebvre has ""an     erroneous concept of Tradition."" If this were so, Cardinal     Ratzinger could not, on behalf of the Pope, have addressed to the     Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July    ""Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it     the means to live and prosper testifies to your attachment to     the Faith of all time... the Holy Father understands your concern     and shares it.""

" One thing that I havent seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between IBD inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids (FAs).  I was diagnosed last May w/Crohns of the terminal ileum. When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are discussed in ""Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"" MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]  But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed laypersons perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of ""bad"" prostanoid products to ""good"" prostanoid products could still be fairly ""bad."" Isnt this ratio the issue?  Whats the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).  -Brian <bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu>  ",3,sci.med
" Greetings,  Probably a tired old horse, but...  maybe with a slightly different twist.  I wanted to know if there are any good English-language texts for learning ancient Hebrew, and how these compare with German educational texts qualitywise, if anybody has an idea.  I cant figure out if I should buy one here for later study or wait until I get back to the U.S.  Something I find interesting about studying theology in Germany is the fact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the way early [Im not a theology student, but I spend a lot of time with such folks] in their careers.  They take the first two years or so to just do Greek and Latin and Hebrew [possibly Aramaic, too--who knows]. Whats it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States?

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port  	If youve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard 	(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then youre going to have a hard time finding 	a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation 	runs the X window system, youre in luck.  You can buy a cheap used 	PC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable 	to your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read 	the serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.  	The two main programs Ive found to do this are KT and A2X.  	a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and 	even moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server 	extension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your 	server can do this, run xdpyinfo and see if any of these strings 	appear in the extensions list.  If your server doesnt have this, 	you may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later, 	or bugging your vendor.  	kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers. 	Another program called xsendevent also exists, but I havent seen it.  	Both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.      2. X terminals  	Also, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use 	PC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all 	set.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the 	trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add 	extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around 	for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.      3. NeXT  	NeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop 	Bus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they 	were cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of 	upgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!      4. Silicon Graphics  	Silicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and 	beyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I dont 	believe this also applies to the Power Series machines.  Its not 	possible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by 	upgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more 	details.      5. IBM RS/6000  	IBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  || 	Unfortunately, you cant just plug one in.  You need two	cable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   || 	smaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.

Other stuff  	Some vendors here (	support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your 	queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.

" In a previous article, dleonar@andy.bgsu.edu (Pixie) >     Do the words ""Question Authority"" mean anything to you? > >     I defy any theist to reply.        Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.   You have to be very careful about what you mean by ""question authority"". Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative, and to say ""I question to word of this authority"" is ridiculous. If it is  open to question, it isnt an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase here should be ""authenticate authority."" Once you have authenticated your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as an authority.   The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You  can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of discourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in inself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and  other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.) I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings,  because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I dont need an  authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which I cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must do it by some means other than by examining its teachings.   In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we dont have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to  verify for himself.  In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source  ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am a Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem the strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).  The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty. If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of every receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly change. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific.   To demand scintific or rational proof of Gods existence, is to deny Gods existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very nature, prove anything.    --  ============================================================================== Mark Baker                  | ""The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but  aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts."" -- C.

As for the faith that you have, keep that between yourself and God. The person is in luck who doesnt condemn himself for what he samples. On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isnt acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.  [As far as I know, Christians (except specific Jewish Christian groups, and maybe some of the sabbatarians -- both of which are very small groups) do not practice circumcision on religious grounds.

" I must have missed the postings about Waco, David Koresh, and the Second Coming.  How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  Im not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didnt.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christs day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didnt accept as the Messiah.  So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.

But I ask, what holds   someone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by  faith?  [ a couple of paragraphs deleted.universe exist"" ]  = I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely =  = 1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists? =  = and =  = 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing? =  = It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, = is it a meaningful question, after all? = = I would say it isnt. Consider the Apparently it *is* for many persons.  Hence, we *have* religions.  = The question ""why anything exists"" can be countered by = demanding answer to a question ""why there is nothing in nothingness, = or in non-existence"".  Actually, both questions turn out to be = devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that dont exist = dont exist. Tautology at its best.  Carefully examine the original question, and then the ""counter-question"".  The first asks ""Why"", while the second is a request for definition.  It  doesnt address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define  the lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for how do we identify something as ""nothing"" (arent they mutually exclusive terms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is nearing the limits of this simple laymans ability to comprehend, and I would appreciate an explanation).   I might add, the worldview of ""Things that exist do, and things that dont...dont"" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable, as does the theists belief in God.  It is based on the assumption that there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately (un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a reason.  We come to this. Either ""I am, therefore I am."", or ""I am for a reason."" If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are satisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just beginning.    = I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Time will tell. 8^)  =  = Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is = Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this = answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is = actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and = them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Agreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as well.  = Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. = This sounds much better, but I am tempted to= Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, = it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always = existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.  This does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His *qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).  = The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable = of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not = accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  Like the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes  that the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against  scientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the Creator.  I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer ""why"".   It appears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer.    = : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a ""why"".  That isnt = : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural). =  = This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us ""how"", = not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the ""why"" = questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the = supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is = as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.  My apologies.  I was using why as ""why did this come to be"".  Why did pre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.  But we come to the admission that science fails to answer ""Why?"".  Because it cant be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the question invalid? = : I dont believe *any* = : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite = : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion. =  = This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are = somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians = in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce = they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  I suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was  *vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming ""Inquisition!"", note I said *vindicated*.  I certainly hope weve gotten beyond the ""shooting the messenger"" stage).  M. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask ""What do I  as an individual Christian base my faith on?""  Will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our ""sacred cows"" or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and continues to say) in his Word?  ""Why do I ask why?"" (apologies to Budweiser and company 8^]).  Jason.    --  Jason D.

"  Hi, maybe someone can help me here... I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now. The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.)  Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I dont know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? Or is this an indication that the car was abused? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but, I dont know how to verify this...  Ive seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.  Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept, its currently out of warranty (a similarly priced 90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left) and I dont want to worry about paying for any repair bills... But, I also need a car for 5 people...    When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?  I would very much appreciate your input in this.

" jec@watson.ibm.com: A very simple question : it seems to me that the contraceptive : pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to : fall every month.

Actually that is not how the pill works, but it *is* how the IUD works. The oral contraceptive pill actually *prevents* ovulation from occuring by providing negatve feedback to the pituitary gland, and thus preventing the LH surge that normally occurs at the time of ovulation.

" I have come across what I consider to be an excellent tract. It is a bit lengthy for a posting, but I thought Id share it with all of you anyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.   =======================================================================                      D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?     Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,    tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, ""God Loves You.""  Isnt    that true?   A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read    in one of the most quoted verses in the        For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten       Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but       have everlasting life.                               John     However, Gods love is qualified.  The Bible        The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the      loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs        For  the LORD knoweth the way of the      the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm    Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good    I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How    can these verses apply to me?   A. By  Gods  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is    looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The    Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.    On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before    God.         As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not      is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after       God.                                            Romans        The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately    Q. If I am such a wicked person in Gods sight, what will God do to me?   A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will    come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.         For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the       lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,       and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap       mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They       shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,       and  with  bitter      beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.                                                 Deuteronomy    Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not    that bad.   A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-    ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible    makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal    and consists of perpetual suffering.         And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was       cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation        So  shall it be at the end of the      forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall       cast them into the furnace of      gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew        ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with       his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them       that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord       Jesus      destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory       of his power;                            2 Thessalonians    Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?   A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be    accountable to God for his actions.  Gods perfect  justice  demands    payment for sin.         For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans        For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;       that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,       according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.                                                   2 Corinthians        But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,       they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.                                                        Matthew    Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought    to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?   A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our    substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our    sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus    Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.         All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one       to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of       us all.                                            Isaiah        But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for       our      and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah        For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also       received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the       scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the       third day according to the        For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that       we might be made the righteousness of God in him.                                                   2 Corinthians    Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was    already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about    Hell anymore?   A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it    is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.    Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.         He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting      that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath       of God abideth on him.                               John    Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that    the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to    Hell?   A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our    minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole    lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to    the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins    and serve Christ as our Lord.         No man can serve two      and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and       despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.                                                         Matthew        Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be       blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the       presence of the Lord;                                Acts    Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except    through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their    followers also go to Hell?   A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-    able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other    religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their    followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and    save us.         Neither  is  there  salvation  in any      other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be       saved.                                               Acts     Jesus        I  am the way, the truth, and the      Father, but by me.                                   John        If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us       our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.                                                           1 John    Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?   A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You    must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see    your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.         And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much       as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,       God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke        ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe       on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...                                                        Acts    Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?   A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He    also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that    He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.         For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of     God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,    if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you    should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is    the only Word of God.    In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented    paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.         So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of       God.                                              Romans    Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?   A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging    our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.         The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken      contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm     Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin    to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we    sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins    as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to    Hell.         Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him       to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his       iniquities.                                          Acts    Q. Doesnt  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be    baptized?  Will these save me?   A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.    No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  Gods    sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-    ure.  Salvation is         Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians    Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?   A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed    into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-    more.         For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,       with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the       clouds,  to meet the Lord in the      with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians    Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?   A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens    and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-    more.         But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in       the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and       the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and       the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...       Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new       heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.                                                      2 Peter    Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will    come?   A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to    save.         And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the       world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end       come.                                            Matthew    Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?   A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing    of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the    Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not    come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the    Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be    very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.         For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden       destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with       child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians        Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his       secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos    Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.   A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to    destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.         And Jonah began to enter into the city a days journey, and he       cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be       overthrown.                                          Jonah    Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?   A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented    of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.         But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry       mightily unto      way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can       tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his       fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah    Q. Did God hear their prayers?   A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.     Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-    ment?   A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has    become very short.         How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which       at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed       unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews        In  God is my salvation and my      and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye       people,  pour  out  your heart before      us.

A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.     I have read Mr. Campings book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain a copy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself, you may find the following information    I  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedly agree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  than ever  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Actsam  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

" A few points about Marys being taken into heaven at the end of her life on One piece of evidence for Marys assumption into heaven is the fact that no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was buried. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why? Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.  Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.  The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and Christs act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave.  One laston the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe. The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would makecross, would want to share in his death.  Brian Finnerty ",1,soc.religion.christian

"    Hello,    I have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the  newsgroup, and I think that they can be used to explain each other.   Unfortunately I dont have direct quotes handy...  1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.  2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death    is unfair.    I dont see what the problem is!  To Christians, Hell is, by definition,  eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.  Theres no reason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad enough.   Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view, since the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such.  Personally, I dont think that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--I treat both these statements as metaphorical.

" My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago. Weve kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, thisll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what Ive seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But its hard.    From time to time Ive wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but Ive always thought, ""Why be dramatic? And you know hell only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back."" Its been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of.    Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasnt going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didnt want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time shes ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if shes divorced my brother, and that its a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.       I have mixed feelings. Im proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that hes willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they cant ""get away"" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they cant see a way out of--or they cant bear to take whatever paths they do see. And Im frustrated because I dont know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; Im having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.)   Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?   Heres the big question Ive been evading throughout this long, longcharity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or post.   Thank you.

Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable 	number of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either 	manually or automatically.    	While these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you 	are writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from 	a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great 	advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you 	are doing.	My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to 	my writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which 	actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left 	arm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been 	very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.  	I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but 	these are not much good because they do not give an audible 	warning of the end of the time period!   KEYBOARD REMAPPINGso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.

" Hi there netters, I have a question I would very much like to see some discussionIs there such a thing as a justifible war?   What I would love to see it some basis from scripture foris wrong"", or ""Some war is justifiable"".   To get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the   question. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New   Zealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of   it, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).   Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved   in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation   hardware as the very best a real flyer could ask for. My favourite   computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both   past and present.   I became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all   military activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition   to Gods commandments to love one another, especially ones enemies.  During the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to   the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation   technology I so admire - The F117A Stealh bomber, the F14, F15 and F16   strike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy   simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddams   bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his   Migs in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful   game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.   One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact   of war ispilot is simply a target. Dead civilians are collateral damage. These   euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose   support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to   look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.  Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and   the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in   the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of   Sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,   has caused me to rethink where I stand on justifiable war.  I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say   - Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut   reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality   history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for   my reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I   am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.  1. The Second World War 	- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped. 	- Massive civilian casualties on both sides  		- Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki 	- Probably justifiable.  2. Korean war 	- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically 	  communism vs. capitalism. 	- Probably not justifiable.  3. Vietnam 	- As above, worsened by US involvement.  4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. 	- Genocide by Khmer Rouge. 	- Probably justifiable.  5. Iraq (Desert Storm) 	- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply 	- Other factors such as genocide. 	- Not sure, but probably justifiable  6. A future involvement in Bosnia 	- Genocide - so called Ethnic Cleansing 	- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties. 	- Probably justifiable  7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,   somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya   or Israel. 	- My feelings in this are simple 	- Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent 	- I love the New Zealand governments stand on banning all nuclear 	  armed or powered warships from NZ port. 	- Never justifiable.

" Im interested if anyone out here can point me towards a review of the following book in any scholarly Christian journal, whether it be conservative or liberal, Protestant or Catholic.  _The_Lost_Years_of_Jesus_ (documentary evidence for Jesus 17 year journey to the East), by Elizabeth Clare Prophet.  Supposedly this is a theory that was refuted in the past, and she has re-examined it.  I thought this was just another novel book, but I saw it listed as a text for a class in religious studies here.  Also, the endorsements seem to come from some credible sources, so Im wondering if scholars have reviewed it (or anyone on the net, for that matter).  --  Rob Butera        | ECE Grad Student  |     ""Only sick music makes money today""  Rice University   | Houston, TX 77054 |               - Nietzsche, 1888 ",1,soc.religion.christian

Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism.  (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to ""awaken"" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day?  Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think  Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a  philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived).  Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion (compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas.

Also, any of John Flinks  or John Bell Raes auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.

I took cafergot, but it didnt help and the pain started although it wasnt as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night, the pain subsided.

Saturn may well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but  since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well worth it to buy the Saturn.  >Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000,  >then their cars will be even better deals.

Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who dont  make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesnt give up the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per- car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.  >Isnt that saving money?  	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.

Such ""extra- >rational"" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.  As has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_ and _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications do indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and reasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.  But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy reasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a large part of the history of science.  There are a couple of negative points to make 1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct verification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What would be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.  (I wouldnt hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though. I dont think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi.)  2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and interpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall, there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations, petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which computations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical function of The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate part can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.  Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals; but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed; that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteurs irrational motivation had led to a replicable, and important, result.  This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their theories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not concede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress the results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position (creationists). --  Mark A.

"  We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on   Nassau Street, Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent   Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to   encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our   three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release   that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.   On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family   will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public   awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Bill and Marlene Sterns daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease   characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and   trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would   lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.    Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis   last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her   lifetime.    Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives   of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory   Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide   support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a   newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid   in the prevention, cure, and treatment.  Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to   those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money   were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant   attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP   Foundations mission is to change that.   Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call   Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the   Foundations booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown   Princeton, or sent directly 			The Recurrent Respiratory Foundation 	                50 Wesleyan Drive 	                Hamilton Sq., NJ  08690.

Notemistake being made (by the SDCNs, as they are known, on this group) with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).  We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well. Their are somethe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent the player has left college ball, etc.  Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of ""error.""  Sometimes a player with poor MLEs (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star. Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some dont (Oddibe McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves realreal reasons why Oddibe didnt hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows) involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting and so on.  But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well. One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.  What hasnt been established is what happens when you encounter a player with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard assumptions fit this person slowly?  It hasnt been established that you can use MLEs with two-sport players. (It hasnt been established that you cant, but then statistics is, after all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton. ""Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,"" they say.  Well, what happens if those numbers simply dont mean what they usually mean? It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in Atlanta than Greenville.    Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank this year, live up to those poor MLEs.  But you guys DONT KNOW.  Whats  worse, you dont know that you dont.  And you dont know that there are  other players you wont know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties  again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  Its not. Its got some error.  Oh well.  Bill Guilford  still thinks ""hairy butt is truly ugly"" might be right ",2,rec.sport.baseball

So what distinguishes, for example, the >Branch Davidian ""cult"" from the Presbyterian ""church""?  Doctrinal >differences dont answer the question, IMHO, so dont use them as >an answer.   As far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and Christians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of Jesuss disciples.  Basically, they gave up a lot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow Jesus.  So what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and David Koresh was not.  The problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good and what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of  laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard to bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find a legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just, then we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice would be followed.  But since judges dont always get it right, we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice of man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice system in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.  There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material being presented.  So we might consider  a ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another religion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire to protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows people to do bad things.   I think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is presenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered, then that man is performing a tremendous disservice.  I know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to say is that we shouldnt be looking for principles that tell us why the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and worship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person. It is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose anyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the begotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and nobody else was.  Stephen ",1,soc.religion.christian

I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything into practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, Ive found that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they are just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this retreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only one area in which disciples stand out from ""Christians"".  Also, another part of unity is a common depth of conviction.  Ive also been a part of some ""Christian"" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thingconviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be unified, they didnt care about the truth but delighted in getting along together.  >The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches >(denominations) with the same characteristics.

However, Scripture   In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.

Look at Stephen, ""a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit"" (Acts >- can one say that only one of these three churches is the >  true church of Jesus Christ?  One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.

It is also the only one Ive seen which is totally sold out to God.  > >A problem closely related to these question>- can we cooperate with other Christians - from these two churches -  >  before there is a unity?

As for those who think about only one church being the ""true one"", I remind them that Markdisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they will not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, Ive heard numerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that theyve ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.

A clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is something ""correct"" for a church/group to do for any reason.  In one of the churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being ""opened up"" so that they would have to step right back in. Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he wouldve since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division within.

" [New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]   Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favorite automotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough. There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such  which means that any email sent the name `foo on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admins home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.  Im not sure where he got it from.)  heres what is going on the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mail coming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the point of contact for administrative duties.  school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses, it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resending the email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name; the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at the actual list members.  the shell script i use is as ----------------- #!/bin/sh cd /tmp sed -e /^        (echo         echo         echo         cat -) | \         /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \                 -F ""The ${1} Mailing List"" ${1}-rebroadcast exit 0 -------------------  note that this script does not know the name of the list; the name is passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiple lists (i run several out of this site.) the script excisesmessage, substitutes for99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -request or owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.

To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points  to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of Gods  deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would  attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic,  this is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day  to rest and contemplate Gods goodness and grace.  > >However Id like to be clear that I do not think theres unambiguous >proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.

Paul  wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before  spending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of  me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money  in their homes instead of a meeting.    >So I think the most obvious reading of this is that ""on the first day >of every week"" simply means every time they gather for worship.   > >I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements >is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian >worship was.  It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly  worshipped on the first day.  I assume that the christians in the NT  regularly worshipped on the seventh day.  But I agree with you that we only  have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip  was.  --Mark ",1,soc.religion.christian
"   							April 1, 1993   I am participating in an NL-league that uses standard Rotisserie rules except that the following catagories are For position	lowest batting average 	strike-outs 	caught-stealing 	errors  For	losses 	blown saves 	higest ERA 	taters allowed  This is the fifth year that Ive participated in this Blowtisserie league.  Last year I won the pennant due primarily to the fact that I had terrible pitching.  I would like to lower my batting average which is rather high because I do have Jose Offerman (who made up for this by helping me lock first place in errors).  Anyway, someone Andres Gallaraga for Bud Black  I can afford to give up Bud Black because I still have Kyle Abbott. However, I am afraid of Andres actually doing well this season. Should I make the trade or not?  Your comments will be appreciated.  --  Warren Usui  Im one with the Universe -- on a scale from 1 to 10.  ",2,rec.sport.baseball
" Hello everyone.  Last week I posted a similar question to alt.wedding.  Now I come in search of a deeper-level answer.  My fiance is Lutheran and I am Catholic.  We plan on getting married in her church because she is living there now and I plan on moving there in a month or so.  I called my Catholic priest to find out what I needed to do in order for the marriage to be recognized by my church.  Needless to say that I have found that there is no ""hard and fast"" rule when it comes to how the Catholic law for interfaith weddings is interpreted. But Im pretty sure that we CAN get married without too much problem; the trick lies in the letter of dispensation.  But that is not why I am here....  What Id like to know  What are the main differences between the Lutheran and Catholic religions?   My priest mumbled something about how the Eucharist was understood...   I have heard that if two religions combine soon, it would be these two.  Any help would be appreciated...  Thanks so much!  Bill --    Bill Burns  [              [First we must band together as friends,      then mearcilessly crush our enemies into paste.  [Weve had enough Catholic/Protestant arguments recently that Im not going to accept any renewals.  I suggest responses via email, unless they are clearly non-controversial.  I would be happy to see positive summaries of both important Catholic and Lutheran beliefs.  Among other things, theyd be useful for the FAQ collection.  But Im not up for yet another battle.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

" -- My boss is interested in a new 300 series Mercedes Benz wagon. Does anyone have any testimonial evidence and/or strong opinions on this car (or line)?  Particularly, I would like to hear about power (manual t. only) reliability, feel, and any unusually good or bad features of the line.  She currently drives a VW Passat, and is being plagued by its electrical problems.  The dealer claims there is nothing wrong, even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them- selves while you are driving down the road.  The automatic shoulder restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along. She does not have the new, larger engine and is quite dissatisfied with its lack of power.  The MB wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems such as the Passats electrical system.  She is also considering a Saab 9000 (add some letters).  Any comparisons between the 9000 line and the Mercedes would be helpful.  Price is not an impediment.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy J.

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something thats been known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a persons risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still rather low overall, but significant.

One of the tell tale signs/fruits that give non-christians away - is > when their net replies are acrid, angry and sarcastic.    I do hope that you are not suggesting that merely because a person replies in an ""acrid, angry and sarcastic"" manner that this demonstrates their non-christianity?  The simple fact is that there is not a Christian on the face of the planet (that I know of!) that is perfect.  I have been known at times to have a fit of temper, or a sulk, but this does not make me any the less a Christian.  One of the points of being a Christian (as I perceive it) is to become MORE LIKE Christ.  This statement inherently suggests that we ARE NOT already like Christ.  Jesus never unrighteously lost his temper.  I do.  Jesus was perfect.  Im not.  > We in the net village do have a laugh or two when professed, born again > christians verbally attack people who might otherwise have been won to > christianity and had originally joined the discussions because they were > ""spiritually hungry.""  Instead of answering questions with sweetness and > sincerity, these chrisitan net-warriors, ""flame"" the queries.   You must understand that this is because Christians often forget to treat others as our role-model - Christ - would.  This is because we are human and falible.  I, for one, do not pretend to be infalible, and I hope that my fellow-men will bear with me when I make mistakes.  This surely is not too much to ask, when I make every effort to bear with _them_.   > You dont need any enemies.  You already do yourselves the greatest harm.  And dont we know it!  > Again I say, foolish, foolish, foolish.  Again I say, we are ALL human!  To my brethren, Ms Duticci has a valid point and we as Christians ought to heed the warning in her article.  We oftimes discredit ourselves and our Saviour, in the way that we treat others.  Strive towards the goal set us by our Lord, but in the meantime, remember :       ""There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ...""  When you blow it - go easy on yourself.  Forgive yourself, as your Father in heaven forgives you!  And remember - and this is something I firmly beieve and cling to - one day, we shall see Him face to face, and in that day, we shall (finally!) be perfected.

" According to mdbs@ms.uky.edu, muslims tithe 1/6 of their income.  Perhaps there are some offshoots of Islam that impose this on their followers.  But the standard tithe is 1/40 of ones net worth, once a year.  The same writer also objects to the Bible for teaching that   > ""woman was created after man, to be his helper"" etc.  This is presumably a reference to Genesis 2. Suppose that that chapter had been written with the sexes reversed. We have God creating woman, and then saying, ""It is not good that woman should be alone. I will make a help meet for her."" Feminists would be outraged. The clear implication would be that God had started at the bottom and worked up, making first the plants, then the fish and birds, then the beasts, then woman, and finally His masterpiece, the Male Chauvinist Pig. The statement that woman is not capable of functioning by herself, that she needs a man to open doors for her, would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult. The fact that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given only briefly and in general, while the creation of the Man was given in six times the number of words, would have been cited as evidence of the authors estimate of the relative importance of the sexes. The verdict would have been unequivocal. ""No self-respecting woman can accept this book as a moral guide, or as anything but sexist trash!"" I suggest that Moses, fearing this reaction, altered his original draft and described the creation with Adam first and then Eve, so as to appease Miriam and other radical feminists of the day.

That is, we  observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced  by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be  its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject  to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being,  Gods eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence  of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the  supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused  phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the  supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very  nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted  to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the  natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being  interchangeable.  - Mark ",1,soc.religion.christian

I used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go to get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.  Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too... until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.  One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right hole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a  break and thought about WHY it wasnt lined up anymore (since it HAD been lined up before, and *I* didnt move it, something ELSE must  have ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move  it back... hmmm...).  After that, it was all much easier to close up.  BTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for. At least it now sits level..  --   E.

" A listmember (D Andrew Killie, I think) wrote, in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of  > Any God who works that way is indescribably evil,  > and unworthy of my worship or faith.  Nobuya ""Higgy"" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):   > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge Gods  > behavior?  It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge Gods actions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of Sodom (Genesis 18), Abraham  + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.  + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?  + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!  + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as   + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!  There are those who say that the definition of ""good"" is ""whatever God happens to want."" But if that is so, then the statement that God is good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants. That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you dont. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general.  Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God) meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result.  When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us. Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity.  (Origen""Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature."")  Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God. On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, I find myself nodding andJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if I were playing."" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a chess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, ""Now, what do suppose induced him to do that?"" or even, ""Boy, that was a real slip -- hes just thrown the game away!"" Similarly, if God understands the workings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.  One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess game. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had thought.  With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total result of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.       *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  In the book of Genesis, we read that Josephs ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and when there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his family. When his brothers nervously apologized, he toldnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.""  I once heard a rabbi speak on this text. He         The history of the Jews is largely a history of events    that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued    survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,    amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews    and of Judaism.         The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup    of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of    the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out    of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if    they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have    intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into    their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few    generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a    disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into    the Promised Land.         Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered    sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,    destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of    the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would    be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.    Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of    assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the    worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility    cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human    sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never    again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.    Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the    Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.         Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming    simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only    prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem    every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,    with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place    of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the    Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in    danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,    that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the    controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish    people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge    of all humans everywhere.         Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by    that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather    the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined    to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and    the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might    think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.    The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah    portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage    from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss    that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of    Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)    were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it    had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would    probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism    saved them.          [Other examples here omitted for brevitys sake.]          Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became    famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR    LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,    everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on    stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the    studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast    Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she    later realized that if she had played the screen role, she    would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.    It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney    offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for    it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking    at Walt Disney, she said, ""And now, my special thanks to the    man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!"" It was the most    memorable line of the evening.         In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in    the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive    to this day, beginning with Josephs brothers, and continuing    with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus    Epiphanes....  After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, ""You were talking about the Holocaust, werent you?"" He answered, ""If that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it."" I assume that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no state of Israel.  Someone hearing the rabbis lecture might leap to the conclusion that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact Gods doing -- that He stirred up Josephs brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaohs heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. And this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has brought about.  I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers willpiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art."" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. So, if Josephs brothers had not sold him, God would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people, but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas sin to redeem us. If Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked Fishers knight instead (dont bother to look up the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid).  Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not Gods doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted Gods plans by behaving justly and courageously.  What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, ""I will harden Pharaohs heart, so that he will not let the people go""? Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather that what God was telling Moses was something likethat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.""  To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are instruments of Gods will?      First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Josephs brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment.      Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.   Yours,  James Kiefer ",1,soc.religion.christian
" The concept of God as a teacher is indeed interesting. Does He grade on a curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought provoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His children. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand until we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the final measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is the final test. Specifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven and one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go to one or the other. The ""grading"" on a pass/fail basis is done by God the Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only God sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, ""...who can know it."" I would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method. That is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain and ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and tomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part of the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly wouldnt be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the love and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we are all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But the Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only the best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love. Its sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it and who doesnt. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who dont go to the other place. But it is really much more than that... There are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for the light and the way Home. Praying that we can bring others with us. ",1,soc.religion.christian

" As our local.religion.christian BBS group seems moribund, Im posting here.  On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was based on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember, because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that the Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were ""melting in fear.""  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and knowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt uncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On the other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in out-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.  The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I shouldnt be so troubled about the reports of ""ethnic cleansing"" in Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldnt be with the Moslims. Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing Gods work?  [The example of Gods people setting out on bloody wars of conquest has always been troubling in discussions here.  I personally question whether they were right even at the time.  But those who believe they were consider that the wars were justified only because they were specifically commanded by God.  Somehow I dont see the Serbs behaving like a group that is led by God in this matter.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

"  This is a two-sided problem. Unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time. The ""breeding"" of these low-lifes is getting worse; our justice system is at best extremely weak to handle these problems. That is why low-abiding citizens should have the power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary  anywhere a threat is imminent.  My Camaro (my pride and joy) got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back. The persons that did that were eventually caught (lucky for me!) but not before having trashed the car.  On another occasion, on my way from Texas to Florida, I had stopped in a small motel for the night in a small town somewhere in Florida. About 5 youths were disturbing my car, setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out. When I and another tenant walked out with a 357 Magnum and a 45 automatic respectively, they vanished.

"  I am looking for current sources for lists of all the home medical tests currently legally available. I believe this trend of allowing tests at home where feasible, decreased medical costs by a factor of 10 or more and allows the patient some time and privacy to consider the best action from the results of such tests. In fact I believe home medical tests and certain basic tests for serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease, should be offered free to the American public. This could actually help to reduce national medical costs since many would have an earlier opportunity to know about and work toward recuperation or cure.

To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism from those who only follow the hot team.  This statement is supported based on the increased number of Brave Woofers out on the net.  A true fan of a  team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.    Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of  detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what  happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly  not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all, remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that far, let alone beat Baltimore.  Lets face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football and Basketball.

Annother tack you might take is to say that ""fulfilling spiritual needs"" means ""acknowledging a ""higher power"" of some sort, then show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you, but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother.

Here is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not clear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be taken as describing what ""science is mainly about.""  Consider, for example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and still not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates, that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that some invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are ubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the definition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are ""mainly about.""  The misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition.  > Okay, so lets see if we agree on> of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  > controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  > extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  > treatment.

I agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.    As to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about ""absolute scientific truth.""  I think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have proven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of degree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence.    One of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim, the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to speculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence was presently available for them, and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)  > The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to > make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study > will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  > many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  > afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  > the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since theyre not part of the > scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  > from scientific acceptance.)   I think a lot of scientists steer away from things that -- deserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many researchers minds.    This is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one wants to become this generations Rhine.  > One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  > unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasnt  > been described in a scientific journal. ...  I think this is absurd.    > Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done  > (with favorable results), but its apparently not acceptable because > its a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  I wonder why the results were not published.  In my field, dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly eases ones defense.)  Finally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either on NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little about either and so have nothing to offer.  Russell ",3,sci.med

Whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window, or dreaming, or having a fantasy,  or watching an apple fall (Newton), or sitting in a bath (Archimedes) ... it is ultimately the result of a lot of intense scientific thinking done beforehand.  Letting ones mind roam freely and giving rein to ones intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas, but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first.    Scientific intuition is not something one is born with.  It is something that one learns.  Maybe we dont understand completely how it is learned, but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the  key elements in developing it.    Informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new scientific ideas.  One thinks, for instance, of Darwins naturalistic studies in the Galapagos islands, which led him to the ideas for the  theory of evolution.    This is why I am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal exploration as important scientific work.  I agree that mere speculation does not deserve to be called science.  I also think that mere empirical studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very poor kind of science.

"     seanna@bnr.ca (Seanna (S.M.) Watson) > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?          The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it.  Easter (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan whore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is ""what is the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?""  When phrased that way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately apparent what my objection to ""celebrating"" her would be.    > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.         No, you are thinking perhaps of ""Ressurection Sunday"" I think.  (Though Im not too crazy about the word ""Sunday"", but I certainly like this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)      For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of First Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?

Are there different ""rules"" that apply to them as well?  Or if there is no more ""male and female"" can Adam and Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are differences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in Messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.   ---------------------------------------  [I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it seems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is new -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.  Id like to suggest that people think very carefully about this argument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of the week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some Christians prefer to refer to ""first day"", ""second day"", etc.  However the majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when they use it is different.  Indeed Id like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be dangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the celebration of Christs resurrection.  Postings trying to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose. They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in peoples minds between their celebration and the pagan goddess.  Its not clear that this is a healthy thing.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

" I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and meyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  Its driving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to  do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we  present to God.  But the best Masses Ive been to were participatory prayers.  Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion of sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do (which is necessary because no one knows whats happening next) is growing. Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually on Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking the role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say ""Crucify him"" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today wed do it again.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were ""invited"" to sit during the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian ""invitation"",  I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the musicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows whats happening, the new things have to be explained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass were just sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about to be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay ""experts"", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing--thats just a fact of bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the Lords presence.  So weve been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass going down?  I dont mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware  of Gods presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should  just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in Catholic Masses lately?

Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history.  The Greek, for example, could say, ""better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead."" (Iliad, I think).  The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their sins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.  >In my studies >of the ancient mystery reliegions, I have run across many poems or rituals or >what nots with the interpretation that those who are of God will be with Him >via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer *eternal* life in dieing. > It was a standard belief back then.    It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.  It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world.  It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient peoples ideas of life after death.  >                                    Today we think we know so much and that >if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two.  >But I think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from a >mist, not those of the older ages. >  Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at ""the turning point of time"" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well.  (At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my views on this subject).  >I have said it before, Id love to post on this but the vulcan hammer would >fall.

I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received.  I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different peoples ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In any case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid, but by contemplating the principles themselves.  On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim.  >maybe at sometime in the future-    Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out.  >Rex  Gerry (73237.2006@compuserve.com) ",1,soc.religion.christian

Now, this is scripture.  By your definition,  >this is truth and therefore absolute.    Hold it.  I said that all of scripture is true.  However, discerning exactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so easy.  I dont believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward others.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)   >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  >to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) >Can you reconcile this?  Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does preach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to everyone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is largely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is  where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.     >Its very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  >on your own *interpretation* is absolute.

Researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically     reduces a womans chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.   For the year-long study, researchers at Long Island Jewish Medical     Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recruited 13 women who suffered from  chronic yeast infections. For the first 6 months, the women each day ate 8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second  6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the     women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection  were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.      The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.   It is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The    researchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some     brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus          thermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used   in commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a          protective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to   try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists      acidophilus in its contents.                                             --- end ---                                                ===================================  InfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct 89 - Oct 92   THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct 89 - Oct 92 IS PROVIDED   ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS   MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

In some circumstances, though, the     organisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,     intestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the  disease is commonly called thrush.                                         Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control      pills or antibiotics. There is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.

It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council in Constantinople I believe.  Andy Byler  [These issues get mighty subtle.  When you see people saying different things its often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things, or whether they are using different terminology.  I dont think theres any question that there is a problem with Nestorius, and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical.  But Id like to be a bit wary about the Copts, Armenians, etc.  Recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought.  Nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought.  More moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox, e.g. Theodore of Mopsuestia.  My impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition, not just Nestorius version, and that some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

" Hell, the Orioles Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history if we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots. Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost gone for every game this year. Its a extremely likelyhood that the Os could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for most of the year like 89).  	On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently.

"  My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over.   The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but  lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was  defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below  market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average  retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but  the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the  Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the  fact that if you have an automobile that does not  depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive  to deal with you.  There is no way that the  manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and  sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded  a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolets  representative at the hearing tends to support this  point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not  seem to take the proceeding very seriously.  I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am  getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have  to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon  myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on  the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to  my elected representatives telling them how utterly  ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for  a ""use deduction"" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.   As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying  for my insurance.  Summary of theHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992  this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems  that required attention included the transmission,  heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main  problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They  could not install a non-defective transmission in at  least four attempts.  So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but  you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you  paid too much in the first place, or if your car  happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.  jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com  ",0,rec.autos

The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldnt have surprised anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the Angels and Royals.

" Eugene Bigelow >Doesnt the Bible say that God is a fair god [sic]?  If this is true, how can >this possibly be fair to the infants?  What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, ""Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit"" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.  As St. Augustine said, ""I did not invent original sin, which the Catholic faith holds from ancient time; but you, who deny it, without a doubt are a follower of a new heresy.""

(To >reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from >uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical >problems are notoriously problematic.)    Okay, so lets see if we agree onof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully  controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the  extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain  treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even  if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that a treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support. In this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.  SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of  evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.     I come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and occasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much of the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years now I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the NLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the *questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation.  Over and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  ""If this hasnt been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it cant be of any interest to us.""    To me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme ""Thereve got to be controlled studies"" position is an NLP technique called the Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Simple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the worlds most  important psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that  it doesnt take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell  when someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple  visualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is useful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once (or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The process doesnt need to be repeated and the subject doesnt need to practice it over again at home.  Now to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure.  (Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)   Take someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up  to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15  minutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to  the balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a  few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term  follow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view  even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case,  there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best  of my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed  after holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done with a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast  Phobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony.)    The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners,  many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill  afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because  the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since theyre not part of the scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain  from scientific acceptance.)   The Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical  psychology establishment is still saying ""We dont have any way of  knowing that its effective.""    These academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate  as anyone could want, of course, but they say  ""Why should I prove your  theory?""  and  ""The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.""   One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely  unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasnt  been described in a scientific journal.  (Its described in a number of  books and Ive posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much  detail as Im capable of.)    Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with  favorable results), but its apparently not acceptable because its a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.  To me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.   This is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about ""doctrinnaire""  attitudes about science.    Now maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.   If so, I apologize.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.     lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet ",3,sci.med

I attribute my success to several Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me, I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.  Very little sugar or salt.  Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (Ive heard of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)  My ""clean your plate"" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last 10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch up, so I dont still feel hungry and go start eating something else.  I dont eat when Im not hungry (unless Im sure Ill get hungry shortly, and eating wont be practical then).  I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to stores, movies, and everywhere else, as Ive never owned a car. I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my metabolism is so low that when Im at rest Im most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others.  But its easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)  Theres no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately, it isnt different in a way that precludes excellent health.  Obviously, I cant swear that every obese person who does what Ive done will have the success I did.  But Ive never yet heard of one who did try it and didnt succeed.  > I think all of us cycle.

" [this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions; the other article contains questions more geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted to misc.consumers.  -- rpw]     [changes as of 14 April    non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]                   Commonly Asked Automotive Questions   Tire    overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually     narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio; it indicates the height of the     sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire     has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel     diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX     tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like     390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed     rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly     inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common     speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to     150MPH.)      Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed     rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find     designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load     associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous     operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is     a table showing a number of `load indices and corresponding maximum     per-tire     Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157     Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125      Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.      In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire     size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation     indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application     of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters     only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of     interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For     the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference     between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at     all.      If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.      Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating     reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)      There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,     traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded     A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is     a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they     are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are     thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.    normal tires on the car?    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible     with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them     so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that     more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)     You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your     car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly     dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,     or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard     to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear     has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.    of my car?    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a     car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others     (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping     is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before     rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturers recommendations.    car should I put them on?    get excessive snow or who dont drive agressively (or at all) in snow     conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there     are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear     wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car     going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car     (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,     stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the     snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes     while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.

Safety    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than     Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than     3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend     to burn the drivers hands when venting the byproducts of the     explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but     not all) may knock the drivers hands from the wheel, making retention     of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.  Brake    always wants to do this.    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors     more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped     warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or     to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas     are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical     to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,     or badly grooved.    this really a good idea?    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of     downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases     of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more     than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they     are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.      On the other hand, many standard drivers license tests in the USA     still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I     suggest that before taking a US drivers test, you either 1) learn to     do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a     car with an automatic to take the test.    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake     system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type     are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The     principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry     boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling     point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest     wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better     boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling     point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see     the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that     DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific     cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly     competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_     improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for     DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out     fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid     out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone     based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and     DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound     like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in     such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any     metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend     to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where     most of the corrosion occurs.      Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to     Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly     beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the     brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.      Two other issues that come up with silicone    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which     interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they     generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they     do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable     in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense     in some street car applications, but they are certainly not     recommended for high performance driving applications, and the     economics are questionable for street use.      I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard     that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably     compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little     information at this time.    more.  Is it worth it?    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer     is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally     work better for the `average driver (that is to say, a driver who does     not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),     and may require the `unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques     like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.      Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the     car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able     be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several     systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is     what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence     of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed     sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and     may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original     equipment or OE-equivalent components.      When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking     the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the     system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS     will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a     sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could     sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is     achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as     the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are     truly engaged is called the `duty cycle; typically in an ABS system     this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this     duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;     on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform     threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on     snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes     locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,     has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this     eventuality.      A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves     steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are     braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release     the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off     on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.     Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.      An important    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on     glare ice, dont expect an ABS system to help you out very much.     The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an     ABS system in your car.      As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential     restrictions Ive listed above, you have to worry about the    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master     cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for     over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5     (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of     the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system     components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid     becomes very important.    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers     in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is     needed here -- rpw]      Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high     performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab     the pedal and lock em up panic habit entirely, and is much     to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate     maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but     just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold     brake learn to feel what this `threshold feels like, and learn     to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake     pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the     threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.     In any case, if you cant hear the tires whine just a bit, youre     not very near the threshold.      In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just     before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on     the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very     close to the threshold and theyll probably achieve better     stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS     take over.      Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of     accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with     ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed     the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now     seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the     involved officers had any recent performance driving training.     There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing     brake pedal by `pump braking, an old and discredited technique     of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to     try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you     think about it for a minute, youll realize that pump braking must     cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least     1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that     much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.     Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective     and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if     you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at     the pedal will be sufficient.      Gas    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.     On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your     car run well.  Check your owners manual for details on what your car     needs.    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase     in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded     gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,     check your owners manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not     actually require leaded gasoline.    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.     Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl     Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs     and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.      Manufacturers opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes     called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owners     manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider     10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol     (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected     cars.      An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with     fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that     do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain     Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything     in your gas tank.      There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are     noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work     much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,     Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber, and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,     once every six months, is highly recommended.    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this     test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test     are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such     gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.     Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean     engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.  Lubrication    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer	     uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are     for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine     applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels     of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,     SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.      The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either     a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by     the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly     used these days, and are the only type that most automobile     manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the     designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;     the W stands for `winter.  The second number (30) is the viscosity     of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesnt actually     get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What     is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity     of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesnt get thin as fast     as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the     viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.      Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not     all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all     30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the     novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has     been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils     do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,     15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure     that they dont overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on     your wallet at all times.    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based     additives that have been around since the early 50s.  PTFE is the     chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,     auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET     responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight     increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term     results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are     debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the     product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes     deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners     have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of     Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50     Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as     it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are     no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.      On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by     oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to     change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your     car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change     the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty     as conventional oils.      Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter     entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very     effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.    How often should I change my oil?    gets warmed up, and you dont drive it very hard and keep the revs     down, the manufacturers recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,     you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you     only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesnt get up     to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,     perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are     now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you dont drive your car     much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change     oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,     then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out     of storage.  Misc.    break.  Whats the story?    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but     the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.     Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.      If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the     belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent     replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if     there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time     (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have     a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,     destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage     as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water     pump can be a costly mistake.)    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression     ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are     more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance     oriented vehicles.    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be     caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the     same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report     goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator     is probably the cause. --  richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of   a race car about either its pitch or roll axis  -- Carroll Smith ",0,rec.autos

My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe >the following to be My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can correct your statements about our >1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.  Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all Ive heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg- ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore hed never drive a car in Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic). What you mean by `better disciplined should perhaps be considered `cautious due to fear:  When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies onfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :). So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if youre ex- posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to handle it - or you lose...  Thats the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation -  whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened) and each accident is one accident too much.  >2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than >   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them >   far more predictable than most US highways.  Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto- bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope thats the right word -  a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; its about 2 feet high); those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very timid.

Youre right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) - but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that in Germany (Ive been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands) - besides that, you really cant rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits.

" I am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what I am going to describe here.  I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on November 3, 1992 atFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like this before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.  Well, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had a bowl of another Kellogs frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am embarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once in a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think ""Oh, oh, this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.""  Ten  minutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.  When I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now after this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even he is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I understand can happen even when a person has a seizure.  Once again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can guess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has.  Sorry to be so wordy but I wanted to really get across what is going on here.

You also have to take into consideration >whether the commands are good or bad.  You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  Im not trying to be contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope.  It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over authority and discipline.    My question to the supporters of SSPX is   Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms   could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that   the Popes position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX   dont jointly make such  choice.)  If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. If I adopt the view that ""Im NOT wrong, I CANT be wrong, and theres NO WAY Ill change my mind, YOU must change yours"", that Ive either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical Councils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines  regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into the merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that a split occurred, and dont paly what appear to be semantic games like ""Hes the Pope, but we dont recognize that what he does is effective..."".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.  >So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak >Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only >way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the >traditional teaching of the Church is.  We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the ""real"" traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.   >Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some >soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually >some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` I may be wrong here, Im not Roman Catholic. :-)  What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? Again, Im not trying to be contentions, Im trying to understand. Since Im Orthodox, Ive got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other.  >Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate >command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But its a superset, so >it doesnt work the other way>schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests dont comply with >the Holy Fathers desires doesnt make them schismatics.  It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the Popes commands as legitimate.  Why?

" Another issue of importance.  Was the crucification the will of God or a tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  Gods will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  Gods will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as its head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christs return.  But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth.  Isnt it about time for his return.

And the two simplest refutations are (1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded ""impact"" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Dont bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.  -Scott O.

Neither of them have exactly been know for their tater prowess in the past.   How have the Rockies been early?

Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure from punishing people?  The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and his angels.  To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the Bible teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.  Their judgement is soon to come.  Let me suggest this.  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.  Stay away from human theories, and only take into account references in the bible.  Darius ",1,soc.religion.christian

The reason I dropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical Simons.  I dont know how many walking encyclopedias I ran across in philosphy classes.  The problem isnt in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it.  Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was writting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was to simple.  Ive talked with Schaeffer one on one.  Ive been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and profs from secular as well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories)  His answers were enough that the profs themselves often were taken back and caused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at different open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well, simplistic.  It certainly isnt grad level reading.  But we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time.  Also, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent* inquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base.    Look, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must add a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know its limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value!  THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.  It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian faith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of ""More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.""    Or as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom.  Lets put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the difference between the two if you will let it.  Christianitys contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very little else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding.  This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the Christian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment and say, ""Father I do not understand you but I trust you.""  Now dont read all your objections of me into that statement.  I wasnt saying I do not understand you at all, but I trust you anyway."" It means that ""I do not understand You *in this situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway""  Therefore I can trust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of Faith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know why, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all the difference.  Now, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted company with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent ""whying"" of a 3 year old.  It isnt just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot know.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other leads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need to know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp that, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust.    If, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian leaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be ambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to us, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity. And that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in practice.     --Rex ",1,soc.religion.christian

I agree that there is truth in scripture.  There are principles to be  learned from it.  Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems  to imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth  (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be  necessary.  It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different  from person to person.  To me, that doesnt mean that one person is  right and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple  minds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly  this intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different  from yours or anyone elses.  By claiming that scripture is absolute, then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong. I just dont believe that God is that rigid.  > >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture  > >to be absolute truth.

Since these principles  are crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it?  Maybe it isnt at all crystal clear to *me* that  their fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.  I think weve established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter  of human interpretation and therefore error-prone.  Yet you can still  claim that some of them may be crystal clear?  Maybe to a certain  segment of Christianity, but to all.  > >Its very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based  > >on your own *interpretation* is absolute.   >  > God revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.

(1 Timothyabout priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them."" (Hebrewsbeing our mediator rather than any other man.  Joe Fisher  [""The people before Jesus didnt have Jesus, right"" may not be as obvious as you think.  In what sense to you mean didnt have? Christian thought has generally said that they had Jesus in the sense that they were saved by his death.  God is not bound by our chronology.  So in some real spiritual sense they did ""have Jesus"". Even in terms of knowledge, while they surely didnt have the explicit knowledge that we have, Christians have normally seen messianic prophecy as knowledge of Jesus, even if knowledge from afar. --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

No one was ever flogged, beaten, burned, fed to the lions, or killed in any other way because of a belief in the resurrection - sorry to disappoint you. The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population  (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism  becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Neros blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Lets not cloud the issues with the resurrection.  randy  [I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specifically because they believed in resurrection.  However the beliefs that did cause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus. Of course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other than a great conspiracy.  The most common theory among non-Christians scholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event -- in effect, a delusion.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

I dont really know the difference |> between the various Protestant denominations.   Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they think of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our  culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer  an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to their liking, off they go to another one.  I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different  perspective on the ""church choosing process"". It seems to me from 1Cor 12 that God doesnt subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all but that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where God is trying to place me.  If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they go to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of God. People should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to family.  If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an  easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more like an orphan. Prayerfully go and ""leave yourself on a few doorsteps"" and see if anyplace feels like home.   I wouldnt expect that God want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand there are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that wherever you go.   In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that base. --  Peter White     			a view of my company.

" The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their quest for more left-handed pitching.  So far, no takers. Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he has also led the team in past years for hitting into double plays, or at least been among the leaders.   Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just one base every day, say third, hed also improve defensively.   Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed. The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays. Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might have seen him lifted in the third in past years.   Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances. The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to steal and has at least one pick off at first.   Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers some runs.  But I dont think he is as bad as his current average. I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw seem to have come out of theirs.   Dodger  ",2,rec.sport.baseball

" As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager  I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with  the results.  The catalog description is as 	The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager  	that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a 	professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two 	counter-rotating ""thumbs"" that move in one-inch orbits -- 	releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.  	Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109  To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021.  ********When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was   QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it, and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could  use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old  one.  VERY reasonable people. ********  I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I  would be described as ""structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches  and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.   If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,  more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require  physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit  to get the prescription for p.t.    The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my  physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles  in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the  headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to  while it is being massaged.  I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my  neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in  the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient  p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up  in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.  I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base unit is about a 14"" x 9"" rectangle, about 3-3/4"" high, with handles on each side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal ""thumbs"" are about  1-1/2"" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2"" above the base.  The thumbs  are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more  toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in  either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side  of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                    _______________________________                 |  __    _______________    __  |                 | |  |  |		|  |  | |                 | |  |  |  \^^/   \^^/  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                 | |  |  |		|  |  | |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                 | |__|			   |__| |                 |_______________________________|   For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if  laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or  neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are also impaired (Im typing this over an extended period of time), and I  dont have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works  well for me.  For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.   If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches  whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use  than the commonly used ""home-made"" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together  (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and  move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than  nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are  not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I dont  pin it up first.  As far as Im concerned, the easier something like this  is to use, the more likely Ill use/do it.  If there are multiple  considerations/hassles, Im more likely to not bother with it.  Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion  for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.   After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,  the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.   I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the  most vulnerable point for me.  It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades, although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out.  I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since Ive had it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also  to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this  was very timely  for me.  This is the 1st product Ive ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and, while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones Ive seen such as ""Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog"" or ""Mature Wisdom"". Im only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,  particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.  I apologize for the length of this, but its the kind of info _I_ would  like to know before ordering something thru the mail.

As soon as you possibly can.  The difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally, any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems.  DONT WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  The remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from a wonderful report by New Zealands Department of Labour (Occupational Safety and Health Service): ""Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and First, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldnt have your hands): (  Wrist  Wrist  Pinch  Ulnar  Power  Radial Now then, problems come in two mainconditions.  Local problems are what youdtendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt. Diffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle discomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles, although theyre not necessarily ""the problem.""  --- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Heres the theory.  Normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict the blood flow.  By the time youre exerting 50% of your full power, youre completely restricting your blood flow.  Without fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out, then they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates nasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.  Once one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the load.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow, and the cycle continues.  Another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves.  They need blood too.  Anyway, when youre typing too much, youre never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor ergonomics, only make things worse.  --- Specific injuries you may have heard (injuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)  Tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild orcause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheaths ability to lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets inflamed, and youve got your problem.  Tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating, and can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more swelling, and more pain.  ""Sub-acute"" tendonitis is more common, which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse with repetitive activity.  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include feeling ""pins and needles"", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation. CTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.  Adverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as neural tension, this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere. AMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS  disorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy  (brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).a way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS conditions occur and why.  Just bemisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you may have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).  ==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment  The most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax. If youre under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out the world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding principle in yourEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every three minutes.  Its also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings, calm down, and relax.  If you cant sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and relaxation are really a big deal.  There are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce inflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen your muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold contrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say whats best for you.  --- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was written in the New Zealand book that Im lifting it almost verbatim from Appendix 10. -- dwallach]  . Let your shoulders relax. . Let your elbows swing free. . Keep your wrists straight. . Pull your chin in to look down - dont flop your head forward. . Keep the hollow in the base of your spine. . Try leaning back in the chair. . Dont slouch or slump forward. . Alter your posture from time to time. . Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.  Set the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There  should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees, and your thighs should not slope too much.  Now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest.  Now, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in the hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area.  If you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning back, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.  [Now, I diverge a little from the text]  A good chair makes a big difference.  If you dont like your chair, go find a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle, back height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in the way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good store and play with all these chairs -- pick one thats right for you. In the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend ""Just Chairs.""  The name says it all.  --- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard There is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some people, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you shouldnt be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your keyboard to be ""right there"".  If you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads may or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and look at how youoften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands.  Some argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today. Check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.  ==5== Requests for more info  Clearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive is incomplete.  Theres always more information out there.  If youd like to submit something, please send me mail, and Ill gladly throw it in.  If youd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be wonderful!  Id love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  Id love somebody to make a list of doctors.

Im not sure who the ""original respondent"" was but to reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum, just as _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreen in our case, reddish in certain amphibia), just as the hoseshoe crab _Limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of the spectrum etc.  It is a common misconception to confound wavelength specificity with being color sensitive, however the two are not synonymous. 	So in sum and to beat a dead	(1) When the outputs of a cone are matched for number of absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength, the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_. 	(2) Cones are simply detectors with different spectral sensitivities and are not any more ""color sensitive"" than are rods, ommatidia or other photoreceptors. 	(3) Color vision arises because outputs of receptors which sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are ""processed centrally"".  (The handwave is intentional)  	Ive worked and published research on rods and cones for over 10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can ""detect color"" is frustrating.

A faith based on fear of hell sounds like a dysfunctional  relationship with God.  Like a child who cringes in fear of a parents physical violence.    Many religions have concrete views of heaven and hell, with various threats and persuasions regarding who will go where.  Competition over who can envison the worst hell can hardly nurture the idea of loving your neighbor as yourself.  >--Rex  --  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu ",1,soc.religion.christian

I believe the rule also does *not* deal with this If Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up and advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball.  However, if the Infield Fly is *not* caught, at what point can a runner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for advancing too early?  When the ball hits the ground?

Theres a lot of evidence, it just hasnt been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used.  For example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book ""Sinus Survival"", always gives, before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his new patients IF theyve been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times in the last two years.  Hes kept a record of the results, and for over  2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief of allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his program.  In my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic symptoms outlined in The Yeast Connection (I agree it is a poorly  written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which I never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage of Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  Im also *greatly* improved in other areas as well.  Of course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to molds, yeasts, etc.  It doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various sorts, and again, you dont have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus since thats the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so theres no reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.  BTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  Youll find a lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.  In summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who havent been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection, I cannot guarantee their safety.  For their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as far as I am concerned.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

" Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other than Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians (havent seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).  Later, Max (Bob) Muir  [The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly cited passages the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and theres no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate position onBible for its sinfulness.  It doesnt seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act asguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically about homosexuality.  In the NT, the clear references are all from Pauls letters.  In Rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. Note that the passage isnt about homosexuality -- its about idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this passage.  It does not use the word ""homosexuality"", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. So its not what Id call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards  homosexuality.  The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cormean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as ""wanton"", and that another may be specifically ""male prostitute"".  Again, we dont have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OTs negative judgement on homosexuality.  Judecontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels, it seems likely that ""strange flesh"" refers to intercourse with angels.  As you can see, the NT evidence is such that peoples conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that the passages from Pauls letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement.  Liberals note that theres no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.  This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But its clear to me that thats mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This appears to depend upon ones reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole, as well as ones perception of the needs of the church today. This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely...  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

" Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate, with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times. My opinion, FWIW, to Mark, age doesnt matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven himself to be average at best. I dont care if he is 15; if he plays better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major league hitter (which is good for a catcher, Ill admit). Santiagos numbers would probably come out the same as Sandys, but I dont have the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.  That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers, they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around .220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at any level, at any age, doesnt satisfy MY standards of evidence.

Granted, I thought his behavior with McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24), had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor, EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF (which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15 best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching his ""prime"" season of 27.

I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs.       We here are *VERY* interested in info on R12 substitutes (in fact I  think we really need all the info on this we can get).

Any info on the substitutes corresponding  usefullness?      I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure  we are compliant with the regulations.  The trouble with regulations is  that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what  you should do instead.       I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol  which has a definite CFC-phase-out schedule.  (Of course the cause of  the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the  Ozone Depletion Problem.)       Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast  to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other  greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by  infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem  (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same  thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFCs  (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which  are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.  Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help  the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.   Fred W.

INTENSIVE JAPANESE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH THIS SUMMER     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   The University of Pittsburgh is offering two intensive Japanese language courses this summer.  Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and  Intensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses  each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin  June 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours  per day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.   Fellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact  Steven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below.   ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO  UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.        ####################################################################### #################   New Program Announcement   ######################## #######################################################################               JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon  University.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific  communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and  January 1994.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the  United States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is  facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.   PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to  develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major 1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time.  2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in  manufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a  variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology, Sociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums will be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or  research facilities in the United States will be scheduled.   3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU,  participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe, and participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan will generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.   FELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS STIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.

Jewish proselytism was widespread. >> There are numerous accounts of Jewish proselytism, both in the New >> Testament and in Roman and Greek documents of the day.  I am not so sure of Jewish proselytism then, but I would like to relate an account of a recent dinner I had with Jews a few months ago.  The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess, whom I had met while visiting my wife in Galveston last October.  The dear old aunt (now  deceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially devout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in Austria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her about politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would  be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.  Within two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to expect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got, however, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evenings discussion was to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling  in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on the ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy, ""which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.""  The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of ""overpopulation,"" rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed mothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this is not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to  bring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus and admonish me against converting to Judaism, ""because it involves too much study and effort.""  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor try to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no Jewish proselytism going on there.  And again, last November I toured a ""traditional"" Jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in general.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience, the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.    --  boundary  no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no he venido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo",1,soc.religion.christian

Anthony Fauci, director of the  U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  said,  ""We must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly  can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will  get around microbial resistance.""  He said any delay would signify questions  over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  Fauci, who co- authored  one of the two papers published last week in Nature, rejects the   argument by one of his co-authors, Cecil Fox, that the new  discovery  indicates that ""$1 billion spent on vaccine trials"" has been ""a waste of time  and money"" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were  infected and were ended too  quickly.  John Tew of the Medical College of  Virginia in Richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument  for  early treatment of HIV-infected patients.  AIDS activists  welcomed the  new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand  the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  ""Weve known about this  for five years, but were  glad it is now in the public domain,"" said Jesse  Dobson of the  California-based Project Inform.

This finding  supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of  contracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the  JAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive  surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies  were conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and  Florida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and  tested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found  that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an   HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.

A6  ======================================================================    ""Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program"" AIDS  Treatment News (04/02/93) No. 172, P. 6  (Gilden, Dave)        The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of  Health has raised questions about the NIHs commitment to an  effort that uses  unorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  The OAM is a small division of  the NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10  billion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available  research grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be  available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for  Natural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid  to become involved in AIDS.  ""They have to look successful and there is no  easy answer in AIDS,"" she said.    There is also a common perception that the  OAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening,  such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an  advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS  community was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists  general lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic  will be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, ""The OAM advisory  panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.

Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus- 6 can attack the human immune systems natural killer cells.  This attack  causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in  the immune systems fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a  factor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.  In 1989, Paolo Lussos research   found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the CD4  T-lymphocyte,  which is the primary target of HIV.  Lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 44 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  kill natural killer cells.   Scientists previously knew that the natural  killer cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lussos   research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural  killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony  L. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube  findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the  body.  Lussos  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor   molecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface  receptor, making them vulnerable to HIVs attack.   Researchers concluded that  herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV.       ======================================================================                                    April 15, 1993       ====================================================================     ""AIDS and Priorities in the GlobalAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert,  George and Nordenberg, Dale F.)        All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only  ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health  problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert  and Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana,  Calif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,   respectively.  Dr. Berkleys editorial on why American doctors  should care  about the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for  the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should  be noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it  is not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many   respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic  development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.   Berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have  on many developing countries, and the increased need for international  assistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political  aggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there  is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach  to international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in  particular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book ""Earth in the  Balance"" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable  international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child  survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the  developing  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically   change the future of worldwide health.  ====================================================================    ""AIDS and Priorities in the Global HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth)        Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible  before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less  attention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller  Foundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and  Nordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as  malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited   economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention  than they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is  receiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most  developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic  diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another  year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS  and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden  but financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a  rampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each  individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley  says he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and   economic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he  concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the  United States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries  with high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic   has been the rule.

The trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90  children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV- infected but have no symptoms of HIV disease.   HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as ""a  hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected  children who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.""   Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial ""is  the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay  disease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.""  If these  vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their  therapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in  the United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health  Organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide.   The study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which  funds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial  at nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the  ACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development.   Preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows  that certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  stimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers  know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease.   The results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined  closely for other reasons as well.  ""This trial will provide the first insight  into how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,"" said  Daniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAIDs division of AIDS.  ""We need this  information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent  HIV infection in children.""   In the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city  areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic.   Nearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during  pregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than  a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing  numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection  drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding  increase in the numbers of infected children.   HIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.   The most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV  develop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These  infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of  childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms  leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays.   At least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger  to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older  participants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no  symptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen  liver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune- regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study.   Study chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical  School, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of  Medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical  officer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAIDs division of AIDS.   ""We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children  for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or  fevers, for example, than another,"" said Dr. McNamara.  ""Well also look at  whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other  significant laboratory or clinical effects.""   He emphasized that the small  study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  products.   The trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from  recombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically  engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well- tolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults.   One vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a  protein  that gives rise to HIVs surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.   Adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is  the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug  Administration.   Both of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco  and the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in  Emeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus  adjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine  contains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in  other Phase I vaccine trials in adults.   A low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15  children.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the  experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone,  considered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will  be told what they receive.   If the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the  experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will  begin.   Each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six  months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

They report that HIV itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling  skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for HIV.  Although the  HIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals  immunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV  itself caused the skin disease.   Our findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease  without affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the  National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues  described their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human  Retroviruses.   Developing animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most  animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this  problem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for  HIV as well as their own genetic material.   NIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse  eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters  contained both normal and transgenic animals.   Institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV  genetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon  after birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an  incomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer.   Some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their  necks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin  lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No  skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates.   Studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a  type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can  cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the  animals.   Tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the  presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.    HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  Evidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were ""turned  on,"" or active, said Dr. Kopp.   The scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in theinfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals immune  systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the  skin lesions, Dr. Kopp said.   Further proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists  exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV  genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.   Papilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the  genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No  lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light.   The transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter  Dickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Collaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs.  Nickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR;  Dr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney,  formerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.

Shalala today announced the first nationwide  clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care  professionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV  infection or AIDS.       The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a  physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on  drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is  funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of  San Francisco General Hospital.       Secretary Shalala said, ""One goal of this project is to share expertise  so patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health  care providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces  treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and  community social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients  with HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.""       Secretary Shalala said, ""This clinical expertise should be especially  helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in  communities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.""       The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and  it is accessible fromMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer  questions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and  health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be  answered as quickly as possible.       Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question  related to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment  information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral,  literature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health  care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate  sources of information or materials.       When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken  by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse  practitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and  inpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant  asks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current  medications, sex, age and the patients HIV history.       This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern  California.  The initial project was funded by HRSAs Bureau of Health  Professions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and  by the American Academy of Family Physicians.       ""When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of  care they are able to provide to their patients,"" said HRSA Administrator  Robert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  ""This project will be a great resource for  health care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.""       ""This service has opened a new means of communication between health care  professionals and experts on HIV care management,"" said HRSAs associate  administrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources  Development, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  ""Providers who treat people with  HIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment  methods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.""

Ill take a try at this...  From the discussions I have been in, and from how *I* have interpreted the bible, I feel that one can pray either way.  BUT remember this, before Jesus, the people talked to God (no other way) and he talked  back.  (audible and dreams, etc.)  Today we have the bible to know  Gods will, and we have his son you died for US.  He was given as our savior, and while we still do things according to Gods will, we pray THROUGH his son.  In the bible it says that if we are not known to  Jesus, we are not known to God.  (sorry I do not have the verses with me)  So, if we are to be granted eternal life, we must present ourselves to Jesus first, who will then present us to God.

There is a paragraph in the New Testament which in my opinion, clearly makes a positive inference to reincarnation. I dont remember which one it is off of the top of my head, but it basically goes likeapostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come, Elijah must first come. Jesus replies that Elijah has come, but they did not  recognize him. It then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering to John the Baptist.

"                       THE EMPTY                    by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D.                               (1894-1977)            When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about      Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for                  Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son                of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief                priests and unto the scribes, and they shall                condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him                to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and                to crucify Him; and the third day He shall                rise again"" (Matthew           Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,      who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving      reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He      knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious      leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that      one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual      death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly      how He would die--*by crucifixion.*            All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the      minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted      would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise      again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.            But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-      tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-      tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.            The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth      between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and      ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which      had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against      the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had      predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and      on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the      disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some      of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the      tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,      they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back      to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus friends, Peter and      John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the      tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came      hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them      to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew           How did this tomb become empty?            One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--      professor of New Testament literature in a large theological      seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*      the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by      bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb      became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the      chimney at Christmas time.            But he didnt realize that Santa Clause never did come down      any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa      Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the      tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.            Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-      bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by      mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.            Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,      tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar      in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)      that the women went to the wrong tomb.            The facts are           First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to      which by mistake they could have gone.            Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or      more people to forget the place where they have buried their      dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women      did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to      the wrong tomb?            Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?            There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the      evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.                    Now when they were going, behold, some                of the watch came into the city and showed                unto the chief priests all the things that                were done.  And when they were assembled                with the leaders and had taken counsel, they                gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,                Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole                Him away while we slept.  And if this come to                the governors ears, we will persuade him, and                secure you.  So they took the money, and did                as they were               monly reported among the Jews until this day                (Matthew           This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the      fact that the tomb was empty.            You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never      questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to      see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.            Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that      the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus disciples      came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*            How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?      Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.            Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject      the explanation, the very character and the later history of the      disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away      the body of Jesus.            First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in      Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to      contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His      resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there      had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,      then proved.            Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would      have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.      It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most      of these men did.            The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ      had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it      would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed      pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing      humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today      as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.            But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to      leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to      what had happened to Him.            Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.            He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning      (Matthew     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper      room at Jerusalem (Mark           A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at      the same place (John     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians     apostles just before His ascension (Mark     8).            As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-      ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed      attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are      unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the      unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the      appearances.            Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our      leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are      antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest      thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.      Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;      Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of      Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president      of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.            But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has      it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.            Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He      claimed to have come down *from* God.            He said He was the way *to* God.            He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.            He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one      else had it.            He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to      us.            Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed      that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*            Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe      that His words are all true?            The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us      that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?            And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead      testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some      day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.            In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all      this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For      He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-      ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a      hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.            Those who have tried it down through the ages--*and there have been      many*--have given their testimony.  And we today who believe also know. ",1,soc.religion.christian

" I posted this a couple of weeks ago, and it doesnt seem to have appeared   on the newsgroup, and I havent had a reply from the moderator. We were   having intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me   if you have seen this before...  Should Christians fight?  Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there   are such things as ""justifiable wars"". I have started looking into these   things and have jotted down my findings as I go. I havent answered all   his questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different   tack, but possibly Ill be able to get into it more deeply later, and post   some more info soon.  Our duty to our Do good to all men (GalLove our neighbour as ourselves (Matt Act the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in   trouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured   man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes   people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).  Christians are by faith ""citizens of the commonwealth of Israel""   (Ephesiansmen"", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles   of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.  We are to be ""strangers and pilgrims"" amongst the nations, so we are just   passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations   (this can also be applied to politics etc, but thats another story). We   are not supposed to ""strive"" or ""resist evil"" (even ""suffer yourselves to   be defrauded"") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in   preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up   Gods kingdom.  Our duty to the state.  ""Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesars and unto God   the things which be Gods"" (Luke""Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power   but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth   the power, resisteth the ordinance of God"" (Rom""Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake; whether   it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing   ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men"" (1 Pet These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a   divine command, but it is equally clear from Actsordinance of man runs counter to Gods law, we must refuse submission to   it. The reason for this is that we are Gods ""bond servants"" and His   service is our lifes task. An example of the type of thing is in Colalso we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. ""Pressed down, shaken   together, and running over""... oops - a bit of a side track there...  In the contests between the nations, we are on Gods side - a side that is   not fighting in the battle, but is ""testifying"" to the truth.  When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become ""fellow   citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God"", and are no longer   interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to   unions etc as well. Paul tells us to ""lay aside every weight"" that we may   run ""the race that is set before us"", and if we are wise, we will discard   any association which would retard our progress - ""Thou therefore endure   hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth   himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath   chosen him to be a soldier"" (2 Tim One of these entanglements he warns about is ""be ye not unequally yoked   together with unbelievers"". One of the obvious applications of this is   marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business   partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association   with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case   the army). The principle comes from Deutthem being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one   unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor- I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of   servitude, and Jesus says ""take my yoke upon you"", so we are then yoked   with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen   that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says ""become not ye the   bondservants of men (1 Cor An example from the Old""Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?"". The situation here is a good   example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.   Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had ""sold himself to work   wickedness before the Lord"" (1 Kings2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said   ""I am as thou art, my people as thy people"" (1 Kingsyoking. 3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted   on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he   found that he was yoked and therefore couldnt break away from the evil   association he had made.  God says to us ""Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not   the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and   daughters"" (2 Cor This is more or less what I have found out so far - Im still looking into   it, as I dont think Ive answered all the questions raised by Alastair   yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential   factor in his relationship with Christ (John Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his   followers (1 Pet We are to be separated to God (Romrelationship (Rom No man can serve two masters (Matt All that is in the Kosmos is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1   Johnnature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is   our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom   was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another   master.  Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to   anyone but God.  The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Timthis does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout   our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with mans weapons (2 Cor Ill probably post some more when Ive had time to look into things a bit   further.  -- Gideon King                         | Phone +64-3-479 8347 University of Otago                 | Fax   +64-3-479 8529 Department of Computer Science      | e-mail gideon@farli.otago.ac.nz P.O.

GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he   intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus   Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to   serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,   the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have   already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.   God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however   there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not   tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to   live with him on the wrong in your life.    Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The   Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sins   penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed   punishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but   punishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in Johnthrough him it might be saved."" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do   with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin   against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews   they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and   dis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the   fater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.   for those who dont have that right, in the view of the bible they stand   olone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.   i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to   Hell? that step is much more rewarding.  stan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu my opinions are my own, you may borrow them  p.s. stay in touch and keep asking questions not just to us but to God as   well, he listens too.

Well, yes, the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out, but the basics (tone, firing cadence, etc.) are determined by the engine configuration.

Good point.  The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote from the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not disqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.

Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the books of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and others were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for the Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the Deuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I think) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of Baranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament only, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.  > My interim conclusion is that Protestant exclusion of  > (at least one of) these writings is one of those traditions > of men one hears of so often.

""That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture, except the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Four books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of Paralpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five books of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach], The books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being Jeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were formerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two books of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.  And of the NewApostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the same to the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of the Apostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse of John."" 	-Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)  	This same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage (397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at which council the same list was enumerated with the words ""Because we have recieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the Church.""  Which ought to quiet those who assert ""in the name of Holy Scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was never any doubt in the Church,"" as the Episcopal Church does in removing the Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not counted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The Lutherans hold out similarly.) 	Earlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also be found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.  ""And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as consisting of twenty-twonumber of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet].... It is to be noted also that by adding to these Tobias and Judith, there are twenty-four books, corresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks."" 	-St. Hillary of Poitiers, ""Commentaries on the Psalms,"" prologue, 15 (365 AD)  ""The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are .... Jeremiah, with Lamentations and the Letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there is Maccabees."" 	-Origen, ""Commentaries on the Psalms,"" Psalm 1 (245 AD)  ""Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to the boastful .... says most excellently [Baruch 3.16-19 follows]."" 	-St. Clement of Alexandria, ""The Instuctor of Children,"" 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 AD)  ""....I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament ... Proverbs of Solomon, and also Wisdom ..."" 	-St. Melito of Sardes, fragment found in Eusebius ""History of the Church,"" and dating from crica 177 AD, Book 4, 26, 14  ""It is likewiseshun.  The list of the Old Testament .... Wisdom, one book; Ecclesiasticus, one book .... Tobit, one book .... Judith, one book; of Maccabees, two books."" 	-St. Damasus I, Pope, ""The Decree of Damsus,"" section 2 (382 AD)  	I would think this enough, though more can be shown, that the Church has always accepted the deutero-canon, though parts have been disputed by various persons.  For if disputes involving the New Testament deutero-canon does not disqulaify those books (i.e. Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2&3 John, Jude, Revelation) in Protestant eyes, than neither should it disqulaify the Old Testament books.  And I must point out that the Jews only drew up their canon in 90 AD, 60 years after the founding of the Christian Religion upon the Cross.  Why should we adhere to a canon that was drawn up by the faithless, in reaction to the Chrsitian use of the Greek Septuagint, which includes the deutero-canon?  As early as 150 AD, St. Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the Canon of Scripture by their removal of certain books.  Protestants apparently prefer to think that Gods revelation was limited by a decree of the Jews in the ordering of their (the Jews) faithless canon, and that he could not use other people, like the Apostles, in drawing up the canon.  The Apostles were most certain users of the Septuagint, as some 80% of the Old Testament quotes use the wording of the Septuagint, and not the Hebrew.  And the Septuagint includes the Deuterocanon.

I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols Law of catcher defense), but thats something thats difficult to prove or disprove from your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is opponents SB%, and thats clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners. Catchers ERA is a possibility, but its subject to way too many biases.     As for them playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big bat, I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves armor is that theyre weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak  defensively if Blauser plays. Id like to see the Braves give at least one of Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich Jays of recent years theyll be conservative and stick with what they have.

"       Following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells. (The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a ""foreign"" body. Where this blocking is deficient, the body evicts the ""intruder"", resulting in a miscarriage. The white cells apparently enhance the blocking capability.) Following the transfusion, she successfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and Jake is now an active 9 month-old who cannot wait to walk.      Were now thinking about having another child, but no one (including the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive pregnancies.

Although Im sure its possible to argue theologically that we shouldnt make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldnt discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderators FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of 1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but ""love the sinner"" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  Im not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved. -- Bruce              CMSR, University of Liverpool ",1,soc.religion.christian

Dont you think he deserves it? >I mean, heck, if Dave Winfield (ho-hum) is seriously being considered for it, >as is Lee Smith (ha), then why dont we give Dave Kingman a chance? Or Darrell >Evans! Yeah, yeah! After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in >Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon.  	Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didnt hit a lick, had negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield, now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime, he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at theknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldnt field, he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his OBP wasnt THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important) was a absolute-primo-dick.   	Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80s.  I know that MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasnt overrated by the media.   	Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This ones actually pretty close.  Hes had a s solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks  (Wrigley, Fenway...).  Id have to take a closer look at the stats (its been  a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.   	You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers, simply racking up a lot of saves doesnt mean a whole hell of a lot if you  blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month) Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one,  the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should  HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO. 	Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOFer.  >     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody >giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by todays standards, >marginal.  	Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISNT marginal?  >Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount dont belong there. Theyre both >shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal. >Lets be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so >liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something  	Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that hes won something along the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a  good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzies more recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early 80s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzies offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (cept against Tom Niedenfuer :-|), but still, a definite asset offensively. 	Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real stiff.  His 82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory, and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as SS numbers go.  Hes a clear HOFer, IMHO.  >isnt done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When  >certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential  >candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to >the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?  	Well, as far as Garvey goes, youre right.  Garvey is a ""mediot""  candidate, pushed because of his ""winning attitude"" (a minor factor, if one at all), and his ""great defense"" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldnt be in the HOF. 	SkyJack?  Ive said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about Morris ""ability to win"" which is nothing more than Morris ""ability to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs"".  At this point, Morris is an average pitcher (although from his early returns in 93, he may be damned  close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the 80s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but not favorites.  Morris career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF ""consideration"".   	Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about ""Yount and Smith being shortstops who  hung around a long time"".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, hes  just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre... (Of course, Nolans a HOFer...) 	Puck?  Probably, although hes got to play reasonably well for a few more years (10 years, even good ones, arent enough to make the HOF, most likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY  tragic or sudden).  Hes very popular in the media and with fans, and legitimately has been one of the best CFs in the game since he joined the league.  Ive always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, its too early to sell.  	This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it  or not, I never tire of it.  Its an interesting subject.  Heres an off the top of my head list of potential HOFers from each team.  I probably left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

" Were the early Christians weird?  Yes!  So were their non-Christian contemporaries (the more familiar you are with late Republican Rome or the Pricipate, the weirder those people will seem -- forget the creative filtering done by Renaissance and Eighteenth Century hero worship.)  So are modern non-Christians.  And Christians.  You are pretty weird, yourself, with your rather acid dismissal of Luther and of Protestantism -- and in apparently buying into a simplistic propaganda model about Catholicism *not* being faddish.   Sure, its so large that global fads take longer cycles than they do in smaller denominations (and local ones are not usually visible unless you do a lot of traveling to exotic lands :-)).  May I recom- mend, as a salutary antidote to this nonsense Philippe Aries book _The Hour of our Death_, a longitudinal study of death customs in  Western [specifically Catholic] Christendom?  And it wont help to escape into the obscurity of the first Christian century.  Paul was pretty weird, too; as were Peter and the others in the (apparently quite weird) circle around Jesus.  What I think you might find helpful is a bit more charity -- try to understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love you would expect others to show YOUR notions.  We *are* commanded to love one another, after all.  And Browns book is, in fact, a heroic attempt to SEE the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and the gospel and their social contexts.  (If anything, Brown is *too* heroic here -- he manages to overstrain himself at times :-))  I dont suggest that we *follow* any of these old cult paths -- and it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of early Christianity *was* like the weird (Christian and non-Christian) cults we see today.  To that extent, I think you raise a serious problem (and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self-deprecatory and ironic.)  But the first principle for *answering* these questions is respect and love for those we do not understand.  And it helps to *work* at under- standing (as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin to withdraw our respect for them as people.)  I would advise, in other words, MORE historical reading (Browns other books are also good, most especially his bio. of Augustine; also try Robin Lane Foxs _Christians and Pagans_, maybe the Paul Veyne ed. _History of Private Life_, some of Foucaults books on sexuality in the ancient world ...)

" mserv@mozart.cc.iup.edu (Mail Server)| One thing I dont understand is why being sacred should make the | temple rituals secret.  The ""so sacred its secret"" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.  | Granted, the Gnostic ""Christians"" | had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely | from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.  There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IVclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III,gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peters response is ""You seem to me not to know what a father and a Godboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you"" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I dont intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.  | Neither New Testament | Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.  But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a 1. ""It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given"" (Matt. 2. ""All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given"" (Matt. 3. ""I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now"" (John 4. ""The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father"" (John 5. ""... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter"" (1 Cor. 6. ""Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face"" (2 Jn. (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.  | I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire | practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual) | from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative | information on whether or not this claim is true?  Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ",1,soc.religion.christian

If they are living a moral life, committed to someone of the same sex, and God is moving in their lives, who are we to tell them they have to change?  Thats my two cent.

" Heres a story of a Saint that people might like to read. I got it from a The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the editor.       Saint Aloysius Gonzaga      The Patron of Youth       The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince     Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured     soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of     Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and     honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in     the manner expected.      Saint Aloysius mother was a woman who received immense joy  from     praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the     life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this     life.  As  Saint  Aloysius	grew, he began to resemble his mother     more than his father.      Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his fathers     soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he     fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an     example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).      About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received     from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself     became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and     asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.      He wanted to share Our Lords suffering to	show  his  reciprocal     love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the     finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of     wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.     While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his     younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.     Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well     with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,     intelligent and always had something interesting to say.       Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint	Igna-     tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)     towards which Saint Aloysius   				  -12-            began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the     marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.      After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in     order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even      through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the     religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.      The Marquis plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his    ness?"" ""I will not, father,"" was the  in-evitable  reply.	""Then     leave from my sight and dont return until you change your mind!""     With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to    ""Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!"" He knelt down     to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but     this  time	he was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This     at last brought the proud man to his senses. ""The Lord wants him,     the Lord can have him."" He gave his consent for his son to become     a Jesuit.      After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-     ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and     could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-     sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare     the dying for a holy death.      Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from	carrying  and     nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever     and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul	to  the  Lord     while gazing at a crucifix.      Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his     humility, purity and confidence in prayer.      Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.      - Brendan Arthur           Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of     others as a sword is to a soldier  God Bless  From Simon--  /----------------------------------------------------------------|-------\ |  Simon P.

" I heard that Eli is selling the team to a group in Cinninati. This would help so that the Os could make some real free agent signings in the  offseason. Training Camp reports that everything is pretty positive right now. The backup catcher postion will be a showdown between Tackett and Parent although I would prefer Parent. #1 Draft Pick Jeff Hammonds may be coming up faster in the Os hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. Mike Flanagan is trying for another comeback. Big Ben is being defended by coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. This may be Bens year.  	I feel that while this may not be Mussinas Cy Young year, he will be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year around August. I really hope Baines can provide the RF support the Os need. Orsulak was decent but I had hoped that Chito Martinez could learn defense better and play like he did in 91. The Os right now dont have many left-handed hitters. Anderson proving last year was no fluke and Cals return to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. The  rotation should be Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, ?????. Olson is an interesting case. Will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get three pop outs? You never know.

Youve just explained why we use OBP and SLG to evaluate players. Precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game. Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - thats where OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in.

I find Mr. Stowells statement terribly simple-minded.  Carol Alvin caralv@auto-trol.com ",1,soc.religion.christian

The last time I got stung by a bee I experienced the same reaction the first posters brother did.  We went off to the doctor to see if I should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times its normal size.  (And itched!!!  Ow!)  He basically said I shouldnt this time, but that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to, but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that next time could be the time I go into anaphylactic shock.  Admittedly this was many years ago when I was young.  Since then I just make sure I dont get stung.  I also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but I dont.    This isnt scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe its not a different reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  Allergies work that way.  People have various reactions.  Sort of like diabetes, some people can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitor their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet like a hawk and use insulin regularly.    I think MSG is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions to it.  Some people are allergic to fermented things and cant use soy sauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesnt necessarily mean that its safe for everyone.

"  Buck Showalter just cant win.   Bob Wickmans pitching the game of his life through eight innings (Yanks lead 6-1), so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete game. Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score, and all of a sudden its 6-5, and Wickman just cant get the third out. So Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces.  Last night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his life (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yanks lead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, ""I dont want a repeat of that near-fiasco with Wickman, so Ill give my bullpen some work."" Steve Howe, whose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didnt do too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and the Royals win it, 6-5.  Whats going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year that the bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together, Monteleones done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once.

This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual >world.    This was precisely my point.  From a theological bent, those who lived immediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a stronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.  It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and thus he became the ""Elevator of the heavens.""  This ""god"" made men able to ""feel"" as if heaven were afar off and ""as if either the God of Heaven could not see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of His laws.""  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled ""Emancipator"" or ""Deliverer""  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many benefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a Deliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of Gods wrath, the other actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true.  >The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is >an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to consign Adam >or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  I dont see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to the coming ""Anointed One"" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the Crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it as a completed action.  Roms makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else.  >It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The >relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely >extended conditions of Greenwich mean time.   I understand what youre trying to convey, but I dont think Id lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.

It depends upon your def of ""lost.""  The elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world.

Yes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as ""mystery"" religions for no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private side, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light. The ""Mystery of Iniquity"" that we find in the Bible, correlates to this I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately, little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point today might be the Masons.

No, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what youre alluding to in that the church, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their worldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you are a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to expound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also the trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinsons ""Egyptians.""  He really does a number on what the Greeks did to what they ""pilfered"" from the Egyptians.   > He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same >time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our >eternal spiritual being had grown dim.

Also, each age seems to have an air of revelation to it.  One age has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine is given growth.

" >If I dont think my belief is right and everyone elses belief is wrong, >then I dont have a belief. This is simply what belief means.  Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion. Some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the ONLY one and if you dont accept their teachings then you wont be ""saved"". It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what God thinks/wants. Especially when its based upon your interpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs cant both be correct. Its all about perception. No two people are exactly alike. No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that there is one truth. Call it Gods truth, a universal truth, or call it what you will. I dont believe God presents this truth. I think it is just there and its up to you to look for and see it, through prayer, meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may perceive this truth differently, it doesnt mean one is wrong and the other is right. As an example, take the question, ""Is the glass half empty or half full""? You can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be true, does not require everyone elses belief to be wrong.  [If a person has what they believe is convincing evidence that God will save only Christians, its hard to see how you can criticize them for arrogance for saying so.  It could be that theyre wrong.  But I hardly see that its arrogance.  Lets look at this a bit closer. Suppose we had some combination of prophets and messiahs that taught us things, but didnt say anything about exclusivity.  If we believe them, and then add ""and anybody who believes anything else is damned"", then you could well criticize us for arrogance.  But in this case the exclusivity is in the message as it comes from the prophets, etc.  So we could be wrong in believing it, but I dont see how we can be called arrogant.  Maybe the world isnt a soft place.  Maybe certain choices actually do have eternal consequences.  I can see calling the Christian message arrogant, in a certain sense (though only in the same sense as calling the law of gravitation arrogant because it doesnt give us any option over whether we fall if we jump off a building).  But not Christians for passing it on, given that they believe it.  The complaints I can see making are (1) that Christians are wrong, or (2) that God is arrogant.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian
" Hi... Im not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance)  I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There is this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it""....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.""     					Thanx in advance... Shaz....  [Im not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  Its pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  Thats because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I dont think theres much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also dont think theres enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect.  Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that dont affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  Im surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  Ive been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, its not any edition thats widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  Its been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, Im afraid.)  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

Without knowing more it is not possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring, or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there are no dietary limitations in patients with Crohns except as they relate to obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on  recurrence of Crohns.  It is important to distinguish recurrence from recurrent symptoms.  A physician would think of new inflammation as  recurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the intestine.

" Nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than sugar.  Some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces  when it degrades nutrasweet.

The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to living cells.

"  So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.   1) Zane Smith should learn how to ""switchpitch"" and return from the DL. I would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.  2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an impressive win last week. NOw Ottos latest debacle has restored Simmons reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his 92 form when he had the ALs highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Teds sake), I hope he pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.  3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently. BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters. Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at the plate in his rookie year.  4)Walk desrved his contract.  5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I cant understand his and managements fear of losing Tom Prince through waivers. Even if they do, whats the use. He is aright hander like Slaught. Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed pitching). Didnt Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere wasnt very fit last year.  6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!! 7)season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks, Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money on Patterson in stead.  8) The Rookie 9) Rookie10)value has increased immensely.  11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount. Lets see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better. Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he wont be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.  12)in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay. 13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmons tenure was getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.  14) Compensatory draft picks forthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed. Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots, nothing else will.  On a final note. Tim Wakefield wont be as awful as he was in his last 2 starts. BUt dont count on him pitching like last year for the rest of the season.

This is a good point.  Christ was hardly the only person who claimed to be the Messiah--in fact, a number of ""Messiahs"" were active in the area from the time of the Roman conquest to after the fall of Masada.   Many of the statements made by the apostles--especially their repeated attempts to give Jesus a sword (give him military power) point to the fact that they didnt realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact.  Many of the statements in the Bible can be seen as being oriented toward explaining  this new definition of ""Messiah"" to the Jews who were being preached to.

" Ive been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers, notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at the Stick.  After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barrys swing was  very impressive -- hes very quick and his swing seems effortless, even compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).  It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  Im not sure if Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbis.  The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters seem to be swinging much better.  Claytons defense has been superb. McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball. So on & so forth.  I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.  For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor in helping them significantly improve over last year.

" Hello, Im back..  I would first like to thank each and every person who sent me a response (be it a positive or negative one). I read EVERY letter and thought about  each one!!   I got all sorts of responses, from ""marry her"" to ""have nothing ever to  do with her again""  Through reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer, here is what I have decided to do.  I sent her a letter today. First, i told her that if she was really serious about moving away from home to another state that ""I would do anything to  get you here in NC."" I told her that I tried to find out if there were  any new stores planning to be built---but they wouldnt tell me.  About her marraige comment (Im not gonna call it a proposal, cause I still dont know if it was a total joke or not) I more or less said that ""Marry me?? Well, get transferred to NC first and then well talk :) :)""  Hopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way.  Needless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...I  have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. If she was dead serious about getting married---I wouldnt do it yet simply b/c she is not (as far as I know to this point) a Christian. It just wouldnt work w/o God in the marraige as well. I figure that if God wanrs this to go through--hes kept us in touch for 10  years now---he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen, it will happen!  She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so Ill get to  see her...and Ill get a letter from her befoe then so I know more of what to look forward to.  I guess all I can do now is wait and pray. I have decided not to tell my folks until Im totally sure what is going on.

Other symptoms shes describedcycle (which is strange for her, because she has always been extremely regular); laryngitis every few days -- she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice, and then the next day its fine; dizzy spells -- she claims that shes had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning, including one that knocked her to the ground; and general fatigue.

"bit.listserv.catholic while main posting goes to  soc.religion.christian.  [Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Marys _blessedness_/full of grace in the ""Annunciation"" by Angel Gabriel in Luke  And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto  a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a  man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgins  name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _""Hail,  thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with art thou among women.""_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - ""the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women"" - while you read on....  In the book, ""First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary"" by Peter The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Marys Conception_ under the title ""The Conception of Saint Anne"", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber ""out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christs sinless body""; she is ""Gods Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.""  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as ""innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve"". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a  greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now lets go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From ""Pocket Catholic Cathechism"" by John A. Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before theirIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the  power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality  and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,  the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding  title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adams sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the puzzle):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born  AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Marys birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriels greetings""Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women"".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin):     Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)     Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)     The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                 definitely want to be with those He                 has made _blessed_)     Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the tabernacle for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart.   -Marida (P.S.  I do hope that others will continue more        light and facts on this matter.  Thanks.) ",1,soc.religion.christian

" All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Pauls letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point Im making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of ""sola scriptura"" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Pauls letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDAs accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  Thats why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

"  	Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a curve? 	Im new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we ""graded"" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the persons childhood taken into account? 	Im sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that youre the experts.  						-Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect thats because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lksimilar passages where Jesus says things like ""even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.""  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and ""Holy Tradition"" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldnt possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, its easy to see why youd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far Gods cheating extends.  Will he accept people who dont explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but its not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how hes going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we cant expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

This topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion flap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice. They showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman constant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter, and you get sick and die.  Ive never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real life.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this book, I would imagine you would have   water.   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.  During this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy.  You would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here.  Come to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.  The most detectable effect would be that the victims body fluids would literally be ""heavy"".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victims weight will increase by about 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victims urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid?

I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered expendable by the As when he refused to accept any coaching about his batting stance.

LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRISTS RESURRECTION              1.  Jesuss enemies *would not* have stolen His                 body because that would have perpetrated the                 resurrection--the very opposite of what they                 desired.              2.  Jesus disciples *could not* have stolen His                 body because Pontius Pilate established guards                 to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be                 stolen.              3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus disciples                 did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus                 had risen from the dead.              4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been                 produced to refute Jesus assertion that He                 *would indeed* rise from the dead.              5.  The probability of being able to perpetrate such                 a hoax successfully upon the entire world for                 nearly 20 centuries is astronomically negative!                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ",1,soc.religion.christian
" >>In article <1qnns0$4l3@agate.berkeley.edu> spp@zabriskie.berkeley.edu (Steve Pope)>>The mass of anectdotal evidence, combined with the lack of >>a properly constructed scientific experiment disproving >>the hypothesis, makes the MSG reaction hypothesis the >>most likely explanation for events.     The following is from a critique of a ""60 Minutes"" presentation on MSG    which was aired on November 3rd, 1991.  The critique comes from THE TUFTS    DIET AND NUTRITION LETTER, February 1992.  [...edited for brevity...]  	""Chances are good that if you watched 60 Minutes last November 	3rd [1991], you came away feeling MSG is bad for you. [...] In 	the segment entitled No MSG, for instance, show host Ed Bradley 	makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them 	(millions are suffering a host of symptoms, and some get violently 	sick); peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven 	personal testimony...; and speaks of studies on MSG that make the 	substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive  	those studies are.  	Consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to 	a study conducted at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in order 	to back up his comment that there is a lot of evidence that MSG, 	a flavor enhancer in Chinese and other Asian cuisines as well as 	in many supermarket items, causes headaches.  What he does NOT 	make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on 	humans but on rabbits.  	One of the researchers who conducted the study, pharmacologist 	Patricia Williams, Ph.D., says it certainly is conceivable that 	a small minority of people are sensitive enough to MSG to get  	headaches from it.  But, she explains, the show probably  	overemphasized the extent of the problem.  	A second lapse comes with mention of Dr. John Olney, a professor 	at the Washington University School of Medicine who, Mr. Bradley 	remarks, says that his 20 years of research with laboratory 	animals shows MSG is a hazard for developing youngsters because 	it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage.  Dr. Olneys 	research with lab animals does not show anything about human 	youngsters.  	In fact, only under extreme circumsrtances did Dr. Olneys  	experiments ever bring about any brain	extremely high doses of MSG into rodents, completely bypassing  	their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly, 	and when he used tubes to force-feed huge amounts of the substance 	to very young animals on an empty stomach.  Of course, neither 	of those procedures occurs with humans; they simply take in MSG  	with food.  And most of what they take in is broken down by 	enzymes in the wall of the small intestine, so that very little 	reaches the bloodstream -- much to little, in fact, for human 	blood levels of MSG to come anywhere near the high concentrations 	found in Dr. Olneys lab animals.....  	The World Health Organization appears to be very much aware of 	that fact.  And so does the European Communities Scientific 	Committee for Food....Both, after examining numerous studies, 	have concluded that MSG is safe.  	Their determination makes sense, considering that MSG has never 	been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed 	to it -- headaches, swelling, a tightness in the chest, and a 	burning sensation, among others.  In fact, the most fail-safe 	of clinical studies, the double-blind study..., has consistently 	exonerated the much-maligned substance.  	Thats quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of 	monosodium glutamate, glutamate, enters our systems whenever 	we eat any food that contains protein.  The reason is that one 	of the amino acids that make up protein, glutamic acid, is broken 	down into glutamate during digestion.  	Its a breakdown that occurs frequently.  Glutamic acid is the 	most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet.  It makes 	up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods, 20 percent in 	milk, 25 percent in corn, and 29 percent in whole wheat.  	That doesnt mean its entirely unimaginable that a small number 	of people have trouble metabolizing MSG properly and are therefore 	sensitive to it...The consensus reached by large, international 	professional organizations [is that MSG is safe], the same consensus 	reached by the FDA and the biomedical community at large.""   -Rich Young (These are not Kodaks opinions.)

" Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can  predict a players RBIs using information about his overall performance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP) that he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This  completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2  could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought Id take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.  Ive started with team data, using data from the Eliass that Ive picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Eliass profits. That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I dont  have team RBIs for 87 or I could add that year.)  If you run a simple least squares fit to the data you get   (RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.  The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the fit is good at the team level.  Ive no started to move on to  the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark, Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to  add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.  It doesnt do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it could just be Ozzie.  The                            RBI-HR          Years        Actual   Predicted Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6 Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6 Mattly (84-88,90)     471       460.8 Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6  I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

Enough with the cliches. My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to their potential, they wont need much offensive support. I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the 92 BoSox in the dust. There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first or second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the mound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most  runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage (providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low  scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many  low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting. On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players, I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers. They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their opponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard. All Im trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers like the Braves have, the offense doesnt need to be as strong.

Sorry to disappoint you, but Im afraid your friendship is in danger.   Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you  are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why  do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has  found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if  you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life.   It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in  the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief  that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him  seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found,  that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of  his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect  each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if  you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course,  if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions  and begin to resent you.  I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing. I dont happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am not offended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations with some Witnesses who came to my door.  I didnt switch my beliefs, but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere, the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.  You may have been conditioned to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious, but why?  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that you will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo. Friendships a two-way street.  You must respect your friend, ALL of him, including his beliefs, if you want the friendship to continue.  Joe Moore ",1,soc.religion.christian

Are you Christian or Pauline?  [Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  Thats why I have to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.  As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies of Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I cant come up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various Christian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups.  Matit applies to Gentiles.  And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the Sabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when youre looking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.  Im not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, its unfortunate the Jesus didnt answer the question directly.  However we do know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus dealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute (Im referring to Acts 15 more than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I dont see that theres a big problem.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

" Robert Anderson (randerso@acad1.sahs.uth.tmc.edu): I would like to get your opinions on: couple become ""married"" in Gods eyes?  Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in Gods sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across theimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewishwas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes  place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I dont mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I dont mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although Im ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --   ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)  	And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?

" Hi Folks,  I recently bought a 1981 Mercury Capri (my first car ever!). I have noticed a few problems with the car :  	1. It gives very low gas mileage (something like            11 miles / gallon ; I hear other car owners speak of            gas-mileage figures like 25 miles/gallon (wow!) etc.).  	2. When I start the car, it goes into high idling (something            like 1500 (or is it 15000 ?) rpm. After driving 4 or 5 miles,             it comes down to 300 (or 3000?) rpm.   I would like to know if there is any way by which I can fix these problems. Or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it has done about 117,000 miles). Someone suggested that I change/rebuild/ recondition the carburettor. I am not prepared to do it unless I am sure it will fix the problem.

Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on  Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically, he said that true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person.

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis.    Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function.  Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas, among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis.  These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant.  Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in your friends case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to you, and offer you support.  Simon.   ",3,sci.med

The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde >produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to >living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.    Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise, since youre forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time.  In studies involving administration of high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable. Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings, say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high doses the bodys detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  Thats because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver. If the methanol stays as methanol and isnt metabolized to formaldehyde, it is actually relatively non-toxic.  --  Steve Dyer dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com aka {ima,harvard,rayssd,linus,m2c}!spdcc!dyer ",3,sci.med

Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not ""cease to exist.""  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies ""separation.""  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.    I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived.  She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my ""girlfriend"" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldnt wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.    >> did you know that Jesus talked more >> about hell than He did about heaven!    >Thank you for this info.

When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh.  You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.    >Being Jesus was allegedly God, I doubt he could honestly feel >     the pinpricks man dealt him...  This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.  Jesus most certainly felt the ""pinpricks"" of life.  As the Scripture Heb.weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  ""The Consciousness of Christ.""  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.    It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He ""grew in knowledge.""  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was ""led of the Spirit"" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise.  That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.    Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.  >Thanks again for the info.  Just so you know, some friends and I >     are starting a Freethinkers organization-- and Im going to >     use some of the info you provided for an organization intro- >     duction... :-)  I was once a member of that club.  THe ""free thinker"" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right.  But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his ""rational doubt"" when in fact he was led to it by his ""faith"".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a ""free thinker"" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that ""sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.  Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.""  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term ""a""-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember.  However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time youre in a room of skeptics, yell out ""Look, your fly is undone!""  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity.  The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.    Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.  >  I tell you what-- if God condemns me for being honest, He is >    unworthy of my worship.  Better to burn in Hell than to >     serve a tyrant in Heaven..  Of course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first ""Highlander"" movie.  But again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of God.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you are to reject Gods annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct understanding of Himself.  --Rex ",1,soc.religion.christian

" maxwell c muir    Just a quick question. If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she    could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin    and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?    Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite    its basically patriarchical structure?  She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin, but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.  She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God, and everything that flows from that relationship.  The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.  (The Fathers in the early Church use this particular figure a lot.)  Eve is the mother of all the living in a genetic sense.  Mary is the mother of all the living in the order of grace.  As sin came through Eve, so Grace -- Jesus Christ -- came through Mary. ",1,soc.religion.christian

Flights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they arent of any use unless they make you do some experiments.  Ive known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they wont admit out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.

This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for Warrens fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created. Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me, Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I.

Im not sure that its random.  But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong, you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_. If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all in mind, you will probably get nowhere.  >(Though why this critical >function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.

I dont agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps ones jealousies out of the refereeing process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.  Anotherdesign.  Id say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_, not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc.

It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole. --  Mark A.

" In article 1373@geneva.rutgers.edu, parkin@Eng.Sun.COM (Michael Parkin)>Another issue of importance.  Was the crucification the will of God or >a tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  Gods will can >never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  I finished reading a very good book, ""The Will of God"", Weatherhead. This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, Gods ultimate will is never to be defeated.  Gods intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) Gods intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated Gods intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, Gods ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly (""not my will, Lord, but yours"") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.  >this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.

Of course they knew where it was. Dont forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didnt  need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus body to  make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a  man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didnt know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a  deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, Im not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth,  but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, Im talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the  body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over  the body of Jesus? He wasnt buried with great riches. So, again, this is an argument that can be discounted.  That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?

Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):  I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.  The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, ""Traditional Proofs for the  Existence of God,"" and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesisa human (Adam) was first responsible for mans alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (Johnis true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newtons head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.   Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.

The cockpit crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.  The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.  Flying can accentuate problems if ears dont clear.  If you dont have big pressure changes, you may not know that youve got a problem.  But if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem.

I Peter One interpretation Ive heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin  of physically abusing ones wife.  The husband is usually physically  stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.   He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an  example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what  is Gods will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals  His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some  degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding  of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the  husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.   One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband  and to the husband through the wife.   Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne@mmalt.guild.org ",1,soc.religion.christian

If it means specifically that the marriage ceremony isnt described, then that seems to be true.

Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems.  The digestive processing idea is changing, but if a food causes problems, avoid them.  Be sure that the foods are  tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  Crohns commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.  There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  It would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in Crohns.

Is the Bible a closed >book of Scripture?  Is it okay for us to go around saying ""God told >me this"" and ""Jesus told me that""?  Wouldnt that imply that God is STILL >pouring out new revelation to us?  I know that some people will feel >that is okay, and some will not.  The concept of a closed canon would >certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets.  On the other hand, >an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes.  There are a lot of people running around saying ""God told me this"" and  ""God told me that"" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others heard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He said someone told him, ""The Lord gave me a song.""  He said that it was the worst song he had ever heard.  ""I know why he gave you that song,"" Murillo said, ""He didnt want it anymore.""  But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the idea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit in the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first to put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one we have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.    Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures. For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an ""M"" who prophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy he gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies because the king complained before he heard the prophecy, ""He never prophesies anything good about me.""  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his  lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples. Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an  apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of Agabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet before he gave them.    So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it  Scripture.    >Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new >but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call >that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldnt that be more having to do with >knowledge?  I dont know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with  prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also  similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies in a seemingly prophetic way, for example, ""And his bishoprick let another take"" concerning Judas office.  A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about what will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural prophecy can be used in later prophecy.    Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge, but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom can overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.   Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often considered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a  bit hazy.  Imho, it doesnt usually matter that much if we are able to label a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the  Spirit, and use them according to His leading.  Link Hudson.

" I need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican which upset me.  I saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain. He suggested medication and a course of treatment, and told me that I need to call him 7 days after I begin the medication so that he may monitor its effectiveness, as well as my general health.  I did exactly as he asked, and made the call (reaching his secretary). I explained to her that I was following up at the doctors request, and that I was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more frequent and the medication did not seem effective.  The doctor called me back, and his first words were, ""Whatever you want, youd better make it quick.  Im very busy and dont have time to chit- chat with you!""  I told him I was simply following his instructions to call on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I  then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he had more time.  He responded, ""Just spit it out now because no time is a good time.""  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my nervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered and then said ""well, never mind"" and he said hell talk to various colleagues about other medications and hell call me some other time.  This doctor called me that evening and said because I didnt express myself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I was pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering how angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told me that he just doesnt have time to ""rap with patients"" and thought that was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to ""rap"" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through on his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he  felt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his patients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me thismistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you but I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I dont have a lot of time to deal with that.""  He then told me to call him the next day for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.  I am still upset and have not yet called.

That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That gives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure off.  Its not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if youre really just here to learn.  Its more important to progress, grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love, especially when its dificult to do so.

(And I suspect that there are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to Christianity.)  I think that an essential problem with communication between Christ- ians and atheists is that as Christians we necessarily see ourselves as incomplete, and needing God (the God-shaped hole), while atheists necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  If the atheists are right, Christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly to stand up for themselves; if the Christians are right, the atheists are guilty of considerable arrogance.

As I can find no Scripture (have I missed it ?) that details when you are married, I have to make some assumptions based on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture.    It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make ahusband-to-be, wife-to-be, and God.  If you promise before each other and God that you will convenant together to be married, then...you are (IMO).  So why do we have the ceremonial part ?  That seems to be there for ""connectedness"" in the Body of Christ.  My brothers and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some accountability on both our parts.  Thats part of the concept from Hebrews about ""not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as is the custom of some.""  We need each other because Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a self sufficiency that the I dont see in the NT.  Does anyone see the Paul Simon ""I am a rock, I am an island..."" model anywhere in Christianity. (Song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?  Further, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA and many other places, and such laws do not specifically go crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture, we ought to obey them to avoid even the appearance of ""evil"" (I Thess So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage, but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the  conscience of others because back to the beginning...you are married when you and your intended promise each other and God to be in convenant.

" Biblical basis for the Immaculate 1) ""I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.""     -Genesis 3.15  2) ""He who commits sin is of the devil ...""     -1 John 3.8  3) ""Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ...""     -Luke 1.28     From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.    First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the first promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of Satan. ""[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth because there is no truth in him."" John 8.44.  Now the proto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and ""the woman"", and enmity between Satan and ""her seed.""  Now the woman is both Eve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve.  ""Her seed"" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the same way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as we do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that Mary is also sinless because if she wasnt she would 1) not be at enmity with the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her sinlessness to Christs sinlessness would be called into question, as would Gods veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the serpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.     Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the Archangle Gabriel ""full of grace.""  As I pointed out above this is from the Greek word ""Kecharitomene"" which means not just full of grace, but a plenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by the footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, ""Hail you who have been and reamin filled with grace.""  But that is a little to long to say, so it is reduced to full of grace.  And as it says, ""you who have been"" Mary had always been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which was also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.     It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done what the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if God could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his Mother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the Fathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo , St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of Christian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on the matter in ""Ineffibilus Deus.""

I am not saying that I totally agree with his   interpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He   interprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good   old U. S. of A.  Thats right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.    The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the   WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese   success of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the   world.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldnt the whole world mourn?  The bible   also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am   paraphrasing, of course).  Babylons sin affected, or should I say, infected,   the whole world.  It doesnt take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a   state of moral decay.  Hasnt the American culture and Hollywood spread the ""do   it if it feels good"" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what   Mr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls   Babylon ""Babylon the Great"" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on   earth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I   dont think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the   most powerful nation on earth.  Again, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy   of consideration.  Jeffrey Little ",1,soc.religion.christian

And yes, they responded very quickly to kickdown requests.  The Nissan had a tachometer so I was able to figure out which gear I was in.  (The Olds may have also, but I dont remember.)  I believe it shifted all the way down to second at about 50 mph when my foot told it, ""No I really want to accelerate quickly.""  I would still prefer a manual, but I wont delude myself into thinking that I can out-accelerate a modern automatic.  And Im very smooth at shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic. --  Tommy Reingold AT&T Bell Labs, Holmdel, NJ tommy@boole.att.com or att!boole!tommy ",0,rec.autos

" Let me tell you my story. I grew up catholic. Up until I was 14, it wasnt an issue for me. Then I met a born-again christian, a very sweet person, not proseletyzing(sp?), not  imposing. I tried to get into being as christian as I could, as I felt I  should.  But the more I tried, the more depressed I got. I felt guilty for some of my own personal, honest feelings. I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict. until I was 23.  Then I taught myself to think rationally. I read a lot of books, pro and con  religion in general and, specifically, catholicism. I came to a crisis point, then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist.   This is a very loose explanation, but its the gist of it.  Now, (at 26) I feel better about myself, better self-esteem, a generally  stronger person. I have well-defined goals. I have a strong and stable sense  of morals and values. I am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain, etc. I  believe in human rights and live and let live among other things. I am very  anti-violent and anti-hatred. (This is to debunk the myth that atheists are depraved.) Religion has no place in my system. Tough.  Bertrand Russell said that we cannot *know* god doesnt exist, we cant prove  it.

" As nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous question ""WHY DO YOU NEED TO PUT MSG IN ALMOST EVERY FOOD?"" I must assume that my wifes answer is closer to the truth than I hoped it was.  She believes that MSG is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated.  To put it a different way, she  believes that for some people MSG causes them to act toward food like an addict.   (Eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the idea! }  IF she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the  food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  Can MSG be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit forming) ?  This brings up a side question of mine.   I have noticed that cats (my childrens and my parents) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food. The cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand.  I have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some sort of chemical training or addiction. My questions, for the net,Does the FDA regulate the contents of pet food?

" The story I related is one of the seven apparitions approved by our Church as worthy of belief.  It happened in La Salle, France.  The moral lesson of the story The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has  been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives worthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and for the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we  disobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger,  has been given the task to make us be aware of the evil serpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience to God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.    The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is  brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins,  to obey Gods commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence  of The Lamb.  As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the Son of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church, the Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are  protected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new  Eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His next coming.      I relate the story    I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions       in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these           two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot          the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the      children that she is afraid shes ""going to lose her     Sons arm"".  She is mourning too for these               townfolks because it was their fault that there          would be drought in their harvest; not much good         food again this year as it was last year.

The children          said ""hardly"".  She asked them to pray every             morning and night.  When the children went back          from work they had to tell somebody about this.

" Is clear coat really worth it?  Yes, on the showroom floor, the cars have this deep, lustrous shine that just cant be found on paint jobs that arent clear coated.  On the other hand, it seems that every clear coated car that Ive seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has fine scratches throughout the paint job.  As does, alas, my 1992 Laser.  Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed. When I picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that I remember from a year ago when I bought it.  Several days ago I took my car to the dealership for some work.  As an added bonus, they washed my car.  Unfortunately, whoever washed it either didnt get the roof (which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before he dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  Now my showroom shine is a haze of fine scratches that arent really visible until the light hits the roof at a particular angle.  I am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  Do I have any  chance of getting the dealership to do something about this? My guess is no.  Is there any product on the market that provides a solution to this problem?  Or am I faced with the prospect of having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches? Information, commiseration, and sympathy all greatly appreciated . . .

GR>   GR>    If you and your patients (followers?) are convinced (as youve written) GR>  by your methods of uncontrolled, undocumented, unreported, unsubstantiated, GR>  subjective endpoint research - great.  But, why should the rest of us care?   Gordon, even if you are trying to beat this issue to death, youll   never get more than a stalemate out of this one!  I have never tried to force my type of medicine on any of you. Why   should I?  My patients are happy. Im happy. You and your peers seem   to be the only miserable ones around bemoaning the steady loss of   patients to the alternative camp.  Just look at Europe. There has been a steady exodus from synthetic   medicine for over a decade now, and itll be just a matter of time  before more people on this continent will abandon their drug and white   coat worship as well and visit different doctors for different needs.  GR>     You see Ron, the point isnt whether YOU and your patients are GR>  convinced that whatever it is you do works; its whether what you do is GR>  MORE effective in similar cases (of whatever it is you think you are GR>  treating) than cupping, bloodletting, and placebo.   This is very interesting. I have come exactly to the same conclusions  but in regards to *conventional* medicine.   You see, I dont just treat little old ladies that wouldnt know any  different of what is being done, but a bulk of my patients consist of  teachers, lawyers, judges, nurses, accountants, university graduates,  and various health practitioners.  If these people have gotten results with my method after having been  unsuccessful with yours or their own, I certainly wouldnt lose any   sleep over whether you or your peers approve of my treatments ---   lets face it, with all the blunders committed by ""scientific"" MDs   over the years, I know a lot of people who hold your *scientific*   method in much lower esteem than they hold mine!  GR>  As far as we know ayurveda = crystals = homeopathy = Ron Roth GR>  which may all equal placebo administered with appropriate GR>  trappings...         Sorry, but Im not familiar OR interested with what appears to be   NEW AGE medicine (ayurveda, crystals), with the exception of homeo-  pathy, of which I took a course. But Gordon, you already knew that -  you just wanted to make my system look a bit more far out, right?    I use homeopathy very little, since my cellular test (EMR) is hard to  beat for accuracy and minerals are more predictable, while homeopathy  does have a problem with reliability, especially in acute conditions.  An exception perhaps are homeopathic nosodes which act fairly quickly  and are more dependable in certain viral or bacterial situations.   GR>  My colleagues and I spend hours debating study design GR>  and results, even of therapies currently accepted as ""standard"". GR>  As good (well, adequate) scientists, we are prepared, *if  GR>  presented with appropriate data*, to abandon our most deeply held  GR>  beliefs in favor of new ideas.   I have met the challenges of hundreds of sceptics by verifying the  accuracy of measuring their mineral status to their total satisfac-  tion --- in other words EVERYONE INVOLVED is happy!  If you were to cook a meal, would you worry over whether EVERYONE   in this world would find it to their liking, or only those that end   up eating it?  Since I have financed every research project that I have undertaken   entirely myself, I dont need to follow any of your rules or guide-  lines to satisfy any aspects of a grant application, which YOU may   have to; neither am I concerned of whether or not my study designs   meet your or anyone elses criteria or acceptance.   GR>    Sorry Ron, if conviction were the ruler of truth, a flat Earth would GR>  still be the center of the Universe and epilepsy a curse of the gods.                            I think there would be more justification for an uneducated person  growing up in an uncivilized environment to believe in a flat earth,  than for a civilized, well educated and scientifically trained mind  to follow the doctrine of evolution.  Genetic engineering of course is now the final frontier to show God  how it is (properly) done. Now weve become capable of creating our  own paradise and give disease (and God) the boot, right?   But just before we get rid of Him for good, perhaps He could leave us  some pointers on how to solve a couple of tiny problems, such as war,   poverty, racism, crime, riots, substance abuse... And one last thing,   could He also give us a hint on how to control natural disasters, the  weather, and last, but not least --- peace?     --Ron-- ---    RoseReader 2.00   RoseMail 2.10 :",3,sci.med

When that light goes on, I just take it to the delaer tell them ""Its that time"" and they work on it for 4 hou and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor) I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the Oxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten. Now, I dont have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and Gasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.    What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and dont worry about the car for another 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against the dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light will go off.  I do that so that little light wont annoy me.  If you cant find it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little and good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?  				- Thomas -  ****************************************************************************** *  E-Mail*	TJZ6624@ZEUS.TAMU.EDU	  *   graduates and Ill win a battle...     * *				  *   Give me a handful of Texas Aggies,     * *  ""Creator of MOT POWER!""	  *   and Ill win a war.""                   * *				  *	  - Gen.

There is no question that orally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence. These areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Now what, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing? Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary, ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone?   How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? Its unethical to ""sacrifice"" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food industry knows this. Thats why the animal model is used in medicine and psych.  If youre talking about straight sensitivity, it would be useful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology.  I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities (You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults (me).  Certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their hidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels* attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC.   >>Between who? Over what? I would be most interested in seeing you >>provide peer-reviewed non-food-industry-funded citations to articles >>disputing that MSG has no effects whatsoever.  > >You mean ""asserting"".  Youre being intellectually dishonest (or just >plain confused), because youre conflating reports which do not necessarily >have anything to do with each other.  Olneys reports would argue a potential >for problems in human infants, but thats not to say that this says anything >whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide any >studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious >reasons.)  It says nothing about MSGs contribtion to the phenomenon >of the ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome"".  It says nothing about the frequent >inability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.  Olneys work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orally administered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH is responsible not only for control of growth during development, but also converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause of headaches? I dont know.  >>>dyer@ursa-major.spdcc.com  >>Hmm.

If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI, but  >doesnt score them all himself, who cares?  Amusing, isnt it?  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.  Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom of the 13th.  Who won the game?  -Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs. -Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent  defensive plays behind him to do so. -Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and  got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of  the inning.  Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for the win.  How about the offense? -Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either  one, the Sox would have lost in nine. -Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single. -Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first  to third when... -Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning. -Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of  a help, but it was something. -Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the  way from first!  (Hills lack of defense helped.)  Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintanas hit that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as much as Richardson?  Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with only one out!  Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.

" Jason Smith (jasons@atlastele.com)  : [ The discussion  : One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate  : (at least to this laymans mind) there must be a causal event.  No : reasonable alternative exists.  I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime;  causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be an answer to ""how"" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from  ""nothing"", science has some good candidates for an answer.  I have always wondered why Christians use the ""There are questions science (or atheism) cannot answer"" argument; I hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question.  The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the universe exist, or anything, for that matter?  I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely  1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?  and  2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?  It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, is it a meaningful question, after all?  I would say it isnt. Consider the A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt ones very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else - I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me - can I ever be sure I exist?  However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )  A being that does not exist cannot doubt ones existence. A being that does exist can doubt ones existence, but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway.  Let us return to the originalexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity postulate). The question ""why anything exists"" can be countered by demanding answer to a question ""why there is nothing in nothingness, or in non-existence"". Actually, both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that dont exist dont exist. Tautology at its best.  I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. This sounds much better, but I am tempted toHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence. This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists, and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence. I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.  The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  The secondbelongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography; see also Lizhi &World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this.   : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a ""why"".  That isnt : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).  This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us ""how"", not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the ""why"" questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.   : I believe the ""genetic code"" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes, : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining,  : reproducing life, *ever*.  (Ive never been much of a prophet, though. I : cant even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I dont believe *any* : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.  This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  There is a problem with youralthough not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although their code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book  StevenCape, London 1992.  Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no  spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them.   : You dont mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your : research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you : really have nothing to worry about, eh?  Exactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to  find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc, but it seems many Christians do not read these groups.

" icop@csa.bu.edu (Antonio Pera)  > Hispanic magazine(April 1993) had a couple of interesting articles about >Hispanic players including its Hispanic All-Star team.  >Some of the major points 	NPRs Morning Edition aired a report this morning (4/19) on 	Hispanic/Latin American players in MLB and how they have many of 	the same problems faced by black/negro/African American players 	when they first entered the league.  However, although baseball 	has adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic 	players still labor under the stereotype of being ""fireballs, 	hot blooded, flashy"".  The report also emphasised that despite 	the rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs 	discrimination against black players in its upper echelons, 	baseball has actually done much better by black players than 	Hispanic players.  	Another interesting point was the language barrier problem.  The 	reporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he 	gave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with 	the fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that 	speak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not 	the) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac 	McCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his 	book, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizations 	employ Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being 	the Oakland As.  	Another 	Nearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood. 	Yet, most report that theyd never really felt black until 	playing ball in the US.     	Ironically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American 	baseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that 	baseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson, 	as many ""light black"" or ""brown"", Latin Americans were 	incorporated into baseball.   	/S --  ""I did not know the cure for the disease      -------------------   of images, but I believed in the healing     |  Sandra Vigil   |   power of words and stories.""                 |  vigil@esca.com |                  - Until the End of the World     -------------------  ",2,rec.sport.baseball

" On the question, ""Does God hear the prayers of sinners?"" we need to distinguish.  If we say that He never hears the prayers of any who have sinned, we make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than 19 centuries ago.  But if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner, of someone who says, ""Lord, I want you to do this for me, but dont expect me to change my way of life,"" that is a different matter. Even here, I would not venture to say that God never grants such petitions (just as He sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good). However, if someone we know well is praying to God in that spirit, we might have the responsibility to say, ""Remember, if Gods help is real, then so are His commands.""

" I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned,      and the trumpet had blown. I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment      before the white throne. Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. They cried for the rock and the mountains. They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The soul that had put off salvation,  ""Not tonight Ill get saved by and by.  No time now to think of ....... religion,""  Alas, he had found time to die. And I saw a Great White Throne.  Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said,  ""Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.""  Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We dont tell people anymore, that theres such a thing as sin or that theres such a place as hell.    As Jayne has said, this doesnt mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to ""outer darkness."".    Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didnt prepare hell for people.  He prepared it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere, that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the elect are the ""whosoever will"" and the nonelect are the ""whosoever wonts.""  Whether or not thats theologically sound, I couldnt defend, but its practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, ""Ye would not.""    Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, ""I dont believe in hell.  I believe in the religion of Jesus.""  But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven!  ""Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount.""  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount.  Youll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire.  Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah.  Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God.  The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didnt want to see them go there.  Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus, not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, ""where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out.""  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell a ""furnace of fire.""  It was Jesus that used the word, ""condemnation.""  ""And this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.    How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?  Not only that, but He went through hell.  Thats what Calgary was all about.  When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, ""outer darkness.""    Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there?  Thats not what hell is.  Hells not a party.  Theres no fellowship there.  He called it ""outer darkness.""  ""Outer"" -away from God.  ""Darkness"" -God is light.    No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  Thats is a sobering thought.  As my son would say, an ""awesome"" thought.    ""My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?""  Hell is isolation.  Theres no fellowship in hell.  Theres no friendship in hell.  Theres no loving embrace in hell.  Theres no hand shake in hell.  Theres no word of encouragement in hell.    ""I thirst.""  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a womans body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.    In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries.  Ive remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the illustration that I gave wasnt his.  His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barbers wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack.  ""They sing these songs and read Bible verses, and their praising this and that -I cant stand it!  Jack, do you think God would send me to hell?""  Jack answered by saying, ""Yes I think he would!""  Of course the barber said, ""What do you mean by that.""  ""Well if you cant stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now, what would you do in heaven where theyll do it for eternity?  Youd be miserable.  Because God loves you, Hed put you where it would match what you really are.""   It makes a man think.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Dont ask me how, I dont know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the ""whosoever wills.""  He suffered eternal judgment.    A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying ""Everybody is going to be saved eventually.""  -universalism.  My Bible says no, Hell separate them.  The sheep from the goats.  "".After you die theres a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven.""  No, my Bible says that ""It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment.""  Some of the cultist believe in annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito youre squished out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven.    I dont enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you dont enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people arent going there, Id give it to you, but I havent found it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore were responsible, the fact that He has placed us in a ""uni""verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications.  1)  As Ive already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others.  Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out.  ""Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men.""  2)  If you havent accepted Jesus are your Savior, youre taking an awful chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation.  I dont mean to make fun at this point, but its like Dirty Harry said, ""Youve got to ask yourself, Do I feel lucky?  Well do you?""  ""A mans got to know his limitations.""  Dont be one of the ""whosoever wonts.""    ""Because while I was yet a sinner, He died for me.""

Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on whos in).  Blauser is a very valuable bat... for a shortstop.   >The center >field platoon will probably hit .300.

The difference between Lopezs bat and Olson/Berryhill could be 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player with experience and a player who can play, Ill take the latter every time.  >The kid *will* improve playing at AAA,   Just like Keith Mitchell did?  >I am just so surprised I have to spell all of this out.

However this doesnt mean that the presence of those >witnesses is optional, except in odd situations like the standard >desert island.  --clh]  	I originally wrote to the person who asked this question personally, but decided to post the information I had on the topic.  	I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently,  by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that  while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the  Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church  recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.    	I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that  couple to be as one.  	While couples may marry without witnesses, they  may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An  anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So dont start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!  	I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in Gods eyes.

" In a previous message  aa888@freenet.carleton.ca (Mark Baker) >If I dont think my belief is right and everyone elses belief is wrong, >then I dont have a belief. This is simply what belief means.   [More stuff deleted]  This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief.  My beliefs are those things which I find to be true based on my experience of the world.  This experience includes study of things that I may not have experienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand the studies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to what I have experienced.  Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find things that echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build my beliefs.  I also find things that dont match my experience.  That doesnt make them false.  They just dont match my experience.  Maybe I will understand that stuff later.  I dont know.  Maybe all of my beliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.  If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what. Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense out of a different set of experiences.  Even though we have different explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the underlying experiences are similar.  Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one form, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic and inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an outsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is a mystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidence available to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I can based on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change my understanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief than my own, it isnt a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover something new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.

" Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of approx. 40+ posts (going backif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more fuel to the flame!  1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though Lopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe), and there were questions as to whether he would be able to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.  I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez can hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was the Braves ""Defensive Catcher"" prospect, while Brian Deak was the Braves ""Offensive Catcher"" prospect.  Besides, Olson and Berryhill couldnt hit their way out of a wet cardboard box, and dont walk enough to be useful.  But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went with the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down at the start of the season, he wouldnt have gotten his job back.  2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around. After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and tear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher (California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work. Plus, youd have to eat that salary, which isnt huge, but isnt tiddleywinks either (I think Olsons at about $800,000, Berryhill at $450,000, but thats only what I recall).  3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to play in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players arent eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster the longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change, but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.  4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isnt on the team. I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves, and the truth is that Id rather see our best team on the field, which, IMO, includes Lopez.  Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we wont need him. ;)  As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went like(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)little smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding is better than it used to be.just wont sign that baseball only contract.  We cant count on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the defense.  Besides, Gormans not ready to give up on Billy Hatcher yet.  Once Hatchers gone AND Deion signs, we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to give us some pitching depth in 1995.OK, Ill look for Nieves when Justice starts having Berry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about Klesko?for Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money or Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell, but somehow he doesnt seem to be the same GM.  First Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he gets rid of Brian Jordan, then Id HAVE to believe that he and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California... if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid. And if that doesnt work, then perhaps Sids knees could be ""persuaded"" to act up.  Theres always the 15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!in Richmond, hell start walking more.  Besides, if hes going to be arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.would recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into running into him again?$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one extra year.  Besides, until Olsons shown his stuff a little bit, I cant trade him.  Besides, Berryhills a left-handed hitter.  You know how rare that is?if you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in the World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!into the lineup.Reardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldnt be used to our pitching staffs stuff.  He got some time with them this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?will be hurt by May.one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant! THE WORLD SERIES!  Ill be up there with John McGraw!  Casey Stengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto, but have you ever had to deal with George Bell?

I stated that I  would not block a would-be passer.  I would not block a would-be passer ""for their own good"" or for any reason other than I was prevented from  doing so due to the traffic circumstance.  I fail to see how deterring a passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances of being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise.  In fact, I could imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your  chances of being ""offed"" or involved in an accident, especially if  this ""passer"" is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a person riding your bumper is certainly NOT a ""wise driving practice"", it  only causes the jam to become more congested.    I dont mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the  road behind!   If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a ""pack""  of vehicles, I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you  decribe.  Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal  with this fact of life, or I wait to a slow passer to complete their  pass and make way for the pack to clear.  If someone decides then to  pull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and  do so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).  I  feel this is not only courteous driving, but ALOT safer than the  actions you advocate!!!  There are actually many courteous drivers  on the road who do not intentionally impede others.    If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they  are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all  else fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the  message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never  safe to ride anyones bumper.  IF someone is intentionally blocking  traffic, because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty  or for some unfathomable reason, I feel they deserve, at the very least, derision.

So after Ive flashed my lights at the chap in front and he doesnt pass it on (and few if any do), what next? On major highways, 3 or more lanes in each direction, keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who are entering. Also, as someone posted in this thread, here in the D.C. area we have a few left lane exits (sounds like 66). If you wait until the last minute to get in the left lane you wont, cause these yoyos wont make room.  We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the Cabin John bridge. There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point where these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic which was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on tother side. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up the two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start- stop for 4 miles. Dave Barrys idea of a laser equipped car would be real useful here.  Bobwith a silver haired driver, then use your signals - I dont read minds, but I do try to be courteous.

The difference now is that such strains have become virulent.  In the old days, such TB was weak.  It didnt spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed (because of non-compliance with medications).  Non-compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time.  That is why we have like 9 drugs against TB.  There is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains.  Now, however, with a virulent resistant strain, we are in more trouble, and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | ""Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.""  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ",3,sci.med

However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn/Lakatos/Feyerabend view of ""progress"" and ""rationality"" in science.  Since Ive addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past, I wont go into them again now.  What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps even the ""correct"") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds.  It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes ""forward"" (and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the ""critical function"" of science.  (Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery. If experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true of the application of any ""critical function"" concerning replication. This is what leads one (ala Feyerabend) to an ""anything goes"" view.)  True, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  But typically it is *not*.  Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from ones political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science. --  Gary H.

If possible (last I heard, it was out of print but they were considering  reprinting) read Barbara Hamblys _Search the Seven Hills_.  It is  historical fiction, set in Rome at the time of the early Church.  She  captures the weirdness of the early Christians and yet gives glimpses of  the holiness too.  Some of their odd views make a lot more sense in the  context of the society they lived in.  I found it a remarkably positive  view of Christianity considering that the author is not a Christian  herself.  Another plus is that each chapter begins with an  original-source quote so that it makes a good starting point for serious  research.

" I have a 86 chevy sprint with a/c and 4doors. Its odometer turned 90k and the sensor light started blinking. I went to the dealer and he said it was a maintenance light saying I need to change the Oxygen sensor. He said, It is to be changed every 30k, but since I bought the car when it had 77k, I dont know if the same thing happened at 30k and 60k.  He quoted $198 for the part and $50 to install it. The part cost $30 outside, but the mechanic I went to could not fix it saying the sensor is placed too deep in the engine parts. He suggested I wait till it malfunctions before I do anything.  If anyone out there owns a chevy sprint, I want to know how they got their Oxygen sensors changed. Also, did you face any problem with fixing it without the dealers help.

" In article <1qhs7dINNj2b@hp-col.col.hp.com> tvervaek@col.hp.com (Tom   Vervaeke)>    ... experience with Jeep service dept ... > While not exactly a service incident, I had a similar experience recently   when I bought a new truck.  I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them Id be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasnt giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didnt think I should be   treated like that and that if he didnt back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldnt take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, Id go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him Id think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretarys name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess Im a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I dont expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure dont expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when its their   mistake.  Anyway, Im happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first years license fee.   Im not sure whether Ill go back to that dealer, tho.  Mark ",0,rec.autos

No.  I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed -- but God is not silent!  >Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new >but rather an inspired translation of scripture.

" ""Darren"" == Dr Nancys Sweetie <kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu> Darren> In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find Darren> arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess Darren> absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines.  and  Darren> In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources Darren> are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own Darren> thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.  The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.   While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin. Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think,  does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend Gods revelation of himself in the Bible. But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For ""the sinful mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to Gods law, *nor can it do so*""  (Romans Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation (""Sola Scriptura""), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, ""But mad reason rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless."" (Large Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many  people would describe as an `absolutist.  Ive seen him  described as a `take no prisoners theologian.  We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others)  as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true (Acts The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the message that ""I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead"" but rather ""I know that my redeemer lives!""  (Jobdoes not side with Pilate in saying ""What is truth?"" but rather follows Christ, who said, ""In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on the side of truth listens to me"" (John We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth.  Jesus said, ""If you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free"" (Johnurge us ""Buy the truth, and do not sell it."" (PrThe Psalmist prayed ""Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth"" (Pswas in fact `in his mouth.    Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the  Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly trust in Gods promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness.  REXLEX> It is only because of Gods own revelation that we can be  REXLEX> absolute about a thing.  Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once Gods revelation stops, Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably  :-)  and less `academically than you would.  Darren> For example, lets suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, ""This is my body.""  Darren> Well presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren> substantiation?  He didnt say.   Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lords supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said, ""This is my body,"" then that is what we should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture.  Recall that Jesus words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also have Pauls words in 1 Corinthiansus, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, ""For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lords death until he comes.""  By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lords Supper really is bread (as well as the Lords body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lords body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.  [side remark] Ive been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lords Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching ""real presence"" because that was the traditional teaching of  the church.

"--text follows this line-- todamhyp@charles.unlv.edu (Brian M. Huey) 	   I am looking for any information/supplies that will allow    do-it-yourselfers to take Krillean Pictures. Im thinking    that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for    sale, but I dont know any of the companies. Any info is greatly    appreciated. 	   In case you dont know, Krillean Photography, to the best of my    knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic    object between charged plates. The picture will show energy patterns    or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type    of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. One might    extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within    the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.  There have been a number of scientific papers (in peer-reviewed journals) published about Kirlian photography in the early 1970s.  Sorry I cant be more specific but it is a long time since I read them.  They would describe what is needed and how to set up the apparatus.    These papers demonstrate that the auras obtained by Kirlian photography can be completely explained by the effect of the electric currents used on the moisture in the object being photographed.  It has nothing to do with the ""energy signature"" of organic objects.  I did a science project on Kirlian photography when I was in high school. I was able to obtain wonderful auras from rocks and pebbles and the like by first dunking them in water.

" Ive noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?  First Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil Fielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations, then even, otherwise, edge to Cubs  Second Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge to Cubs...a big edge. Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an automatic out at bat. Weiss isnt much better with the stick. Even.  Third Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter. Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to Florida. Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to Marlins  Left Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential. I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year. Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May isnt Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays full time. Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs wont remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs  Middle Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins. Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy. A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save. Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.

Given the conditions    I could not stop in time and decided instead of sliding right through the    intersection, I would complete my right-turn and avoid a possible accident.    A police cruiser happened to be approaching the intersection from my left    and gave me the ticket.

Unfortunately, I was unable  to post it before the date of this months meeting.  Im  posting it anyway, and posting it world-wide instead of  regional, in the hopes that some of the information may be  useful or illustrative.  Also, I hope it can be used as an  example and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters  and data related to organ transplantation and donation.    Mike  Transplant Recipients International Organization Long Island Chapter P.O. Box 922 Huntington, NY 11743-0922		 NEWSLETTER 516/421-3258                                          APRIL 1993                                           VOLUME IV   No. 8   NEXT MEETING   The next meeting is WEDNESDAY APRIL 14 at 8 pm at the Knights  of Columbus Emerald Manor, 517 Uniondale Avenue in Uniondale.   Our guest speaker will be Dr. Lewis Teperman.  Dr. Teperman  trained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant  Director of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University  Medical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in  transplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is  a long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and  always a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a  very informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our  hospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence  will be well prepared, and at last the weather should be  cooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome  Dr. Teperman.             WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE   LAST MEETING  It has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of  TRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being  able to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.   No TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored  again, but we were also able to disable the Long Island  Railroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many  braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good  conversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan,  a professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not  able to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to  discuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman,  an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient  was kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman  gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup,  (even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to  minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine  and drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank  her for an entertaining evening.    ANNUAL MEETING  In addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is  also the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official  notice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main  purpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit  member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and  to elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two  year term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following  slate for the Board.           Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen          Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith          Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia          Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)          Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)          Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)          David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)  Those remaining on the Board for another year          Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)          Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn          Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy          Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)          Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)          Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)  This may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work  and with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have  backups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition  to the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also  be accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board  members and there is plenty of work.   In addition,  brief treasurers and membership reports will be  given and the floor will be open for any new business,  suggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.  We will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the  majority of the time with Dr. Teperman.  FUTURE MEETINGS  Remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.         May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry                   Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center       June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony                    Brook Kidney Transplant Program.   Plan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.  NOTDAW  The week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor  Awareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases,  speaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and  Gaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game    because of two years experience with miserable weather.   We all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We  have found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish  a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to  address the congregation, or include mention of the gift of  life in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample  letter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.  DR. STARZL TO BE HONORED   The Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will  hold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the  Fountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas  Starzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and  are going fast.  If youd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne  Treffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.  MEMBERSHIP NEWS   Congratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant  in Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing  well after only 12 days in hospital.  Arthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston  Marathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation  works!  We hope the national press notices.        Bob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his  transplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis  and feeling better.    Nicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie,  spent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems  encountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.   They are back in New York where Nicoles treatment will  continue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery.   Kay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall  that resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a  candidate for the Board so we need her well soon.   And best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough  winter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow.

" Lets look at the effects of inflation on 1930s superstars salaries.  I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Lets assume he made that in 1928 (Im not sure of the figures, but I know Im in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didnt crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that todays players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what todays average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think Im off by much.

True, Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still, these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didnt use relievers, whereas Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.      That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  Theres more of a chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no pitching.  At least, to me.      I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.) Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig, Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.      I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by seasons end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all the offense would have to do is get 1 run across.      I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all- time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results I would love to see that. --  Doug    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love missed the 3rd strike in thehe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!""

The doctor very vehemently insisted that they were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were NOT!  My wife is concerned about this.  She saw a TV show a couple months back (something like 20/20 or Dateline NBC, etc.) where an expert on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound.

In normal condition, the concentration of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid is about  2 uM that is high enough to activate one type of glutamate receptor-the NMDA receptor. But the question is Neuron and glial cell in the brain have a lots of transport to get glutamate into Neuron or glial. So no one know exact concentration of glutamate is around neurons.   Glutamate is most important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It is involved in not only in daily life like the controling of movement, it is alsoinvolved in develpoment, memory and learn (it is involved in Logn-term potentialtion that be thought is the basis of learning).

People are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.  Tests have been done on Rhesus monkeys, as well.

Note that people with PKU cannot tolerate any phenylalanine.  Olneys research compared infant human diets. Specifically, the amount of freely available Glu in mothers milk versus commercial baby foods, vs. typical lunch items from the Standard American Diet such as packaged soup mixes. He found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four-fold in a single meal of processed foods. Mothers milk was well below the effective dose.   >>Read Olneys review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his* >>sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute. > >Impeccable.

I was part of a study a few years ago at the University of Arizona to see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than those with same side dominance of hand and eye.  I was picked from my softball class because I was cross dominant (right hand, left eye) which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  To control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  Since I was used to slow pitch, I didnt come close (actually I think I foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  If there were a lot of people like me in her study (i.e., those who cant hit fast pitch, or are not used to hitting off a machine),  I would seriously question the results of that study!!  I think there have been some studies of major league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was ""better"" - but I dont know the results.

" (Gordon Banks)/ ;Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible.  ;Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will  ;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic ;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want. ;No breeding, no ""hybrids"", etc.  The ethical question is, should ;we?   Two past problems with eugenics have been  1) reducing the gene pool and  2) defining the status of the eugenized.   Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to crowd out ""garbage genes."" This may in the future become possible. Even if it does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We dont really know what the future may hold for our environment. The reduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age, meteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc., etc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival.    Of course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone elses. But if we could make ""philosopher-kings"" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they) want to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their kings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while, it was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing new under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before ""1984.""      I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That hasnt stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their turns came.   Not that I dont think that this gene altering power couldnt wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that, too.    The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally dont think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we may not. If we dont, I hope there are reservoirs of ""garbage"" people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded ""garbage"" genes which will pull us through.    I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same. Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have, and I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God in their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have died out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far, or else havent had enough power for long enough.    In summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in some ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isnt the power, it is the Spirit.   Sorry for the long post. Got carried away.   Bob (ruegg@med.unc.edu)    ",3,sci.med

" The people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly, too arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to see any discussion grace my computer screen.  While it holds PARTICULAR interest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain from discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans.  This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It wasnt enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your GOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be worshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are these icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in European countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical physical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool, His feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all Biblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this important topic; flamers need not reply.  Sherlette   P.S.  I expect at least THIS type ofcolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts.""  This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3 decades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for saying that ""it doesnt matter...""  to a member of a physically emancipated people who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believeMATTERS.  [The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified. There has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We cant discuss everything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasnt been discussed recently shouldnt be taken as a sign of general cowardice, arrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by suggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a few scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic. As you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in art tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldnt be surprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art showing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian devotion to think of him in such a way.  Its also good now and then to have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member of XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

You are asking me to provide objective proof for the existence of God.  I never claimed to be able to do this; in fact I do not believe that it is possible to do so.  I consider the existence of God to be a premise or assumption that underlies my philosophy of life. It comes down to a matter of faith.   If I werent a Christian, I would be an agnostic, but I have sufficient subjective evidence to justify and sustain my relationship with God.  Again this is a matter of premises and assumptions.  I assume that there is more to ""life, the universe and everything"" than materialism; ie that spirituality exists. This assumption answers the question about why I have apparent spiritual needs.  I find this assumption consistent with my subsequent observat- ions.  I then find that God fills these spiritual needs.  But I cannot  objectively prove the difference between apparent filling of imagined  spiritual needs and real filling of real spiritual needs.

If you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus, I think you will find that ""arrogance"" has to do with an offensive exhibition of presumed or real superiority (a paraphrase from my own Websters). Arrognace is about pride and haughtiness. A person can believe in absolute truth, even blindly (whatever that means) without being obnoxious about it. Just as a person can be a ""humble,"" authority-questioning, defying-any-theist-to-reply athiest and be quite arrogant. Arrogance is not about what you believe, it is about how you relate to what you believe and how you present it to others. If your overwhelming experience of Christians has been that they are arrogant, I apologozing both for myself and on the behalf of those who have offfended you. But my own experience, at least in forums like Usenet where you see a good mix of people, is that arrogant Christians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers.  - Phil -  Hey, were talking about the PHONE COMPANY, here.

I believe the last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his 939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of publicity at Rickeys expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as most of the net agrees with me from what Ive seen on it lately.

I posted a message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it is again.  Is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and seizures?  This would allow us to hold discussions and share information via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for two other groups, so the mechanics would be easy.  If you are interested, mail me a note.  If I get enough replies, I will make it happen and provide you with the details.  BTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my research on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program searches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have been seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded and used to improve the system.

However, the ""gifted one"" can >only hear himself speaking in his own language. >  There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which are problematic.  Its use as prayer language seems especially troubling to me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing the talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is God.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where its an actual language.  Moreover, the phrase ""though I speak with the tongues of men and angels"" used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then assume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it is no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.  Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how God PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one amongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.  So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE ANOTHER?  Its disturbing to think that some people find ways to  justify jabbering.  But Ill buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.  Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright fabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post seems like a ""friend of a friend"" thing.  And linguistically, a two syllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.  Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their ""victories"" (since most ailments ""cured"" are just plain unprovable) and modern day ressurrections have never been validated, so is it true that no modern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay.

However when she took it to a local Subaru dealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.  The dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour. At first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there any SVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story is true, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me. By the way, the car looks great.

" Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.   Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night. In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.   Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder and Webster.   Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards. The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single by Offerman.   By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who had strayed a bit from first base, etc.   Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw to third and EASILY got the runner at third.   My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.   Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.   Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3 innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh given his light work out Tuesday.   Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it 3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had scored long before that.   Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning. Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?). Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs of a sophomore jinx year.

"                   _MY ADVOCATE_  I sinned. And straightway, posthaste, Satan flew Before the presence of the Most High God And made a railing accusation there. He said, ""This soul, this thing of clay and sod, Has sinned. Tis true that he has named Thy name; But I demand his death, for Thou hast said, The soul that sinneth, it shall die. Shall not Thy sentence be fulfilled? Is justice dead? Send now this wretched sinner to his doom! What other thing can righteous ruler do?"" Thus Satan did accuse me day and night; And every word he spoke, O  God, was true!  Then quickly One rose up from Gods right hand, Before whose glory angels veiled their eyes; He spoke, ""Each jot and tittle of the law Must be fulfilled; the guilty sinner dies! But wait -- suppose his guilt were all transferred To Me and that I paid his penalty! Behold My hands, My side, My feet! One day I was made sin for him and died that he Might be presented, faultless, at Thy throne!"" And Satan flew away.  Full well he knew That he could not prevail against such love, for every word my dear Lord spoke was true!   					by Martha Snell Nicholson  +++++++++++++++++++++++ I heard this poem read last night and wanted to share it with other  subscribers of this newsgroup.

" Hi,  Ive just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few  concerns that maybe yall can help me with.  Ive been seeing  her every 4 weeks for the past few months (Im at week 28)  and during the last 2 visits Ive gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every  4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.  As it stands Ive thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that  though Im at 28 weeks the babys size is 27 weeks, I think she  mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13  weeks the babys size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had  an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and Ive had no  problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain  in my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very  difficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or  move unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for  when I do need to go out.)   Anyway thats 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from  the beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about  2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.   (I told her about this).  I know this because I wasnt eating  very much due to the nausea and could see the results.  Well  now I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile  related.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my  upper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I  was lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because  it started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt   no matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I  ate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had  turned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if  I ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it  wasnt as much of a problem.  So the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid  fatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware  of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have  been avoiding these foods on my own.  But Im still able to eat  foods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.    But doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat  except fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts,  fried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I  should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only  have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (  potatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I cant even cook vegetables in  a little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or  steamed.  Im concerned because I understand you need to have  some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if  Im not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it  from my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if  shes concerned about fat?  Im not clear how much of her  recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on  cholistatis, which I cant seem to find any information on.  She  originally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the  entire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I  started.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and  shes taken it all off and hasnt had any problems.  She also  asked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them  are.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain,  and feel like Im being punished by a severe diet.  She did  want to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be  temporary for that one week.   What I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I  would understand if she had said low-fat diet, since Im trying  that anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she  assumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that  because of the endometriosis and the operation Im not able to  use the energy from the food I do eat.   Any opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  Im  truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet  because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few  minutes and Ill end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I  dont find any foods satisfying.  Thanks   G ",3,sci.med

" KS> KS>My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome KS>This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg KS>chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information  Im not sure that this condition is ""recognised"" anywhere (in the sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries between it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic features, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.  Post-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease by clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities are mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of ongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks. Musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless contributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows muscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old denervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit action potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation (fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation with reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active denervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme staining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.  Post-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically evident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio, the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one year to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio before who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among polio survivors than among people who never had polio.  The cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little evidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or destructive immunologic response to virus antigen.  There is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have anything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells, motor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration. Both groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason for these ""acute"" changes in a ""chronic"" disease (old polio) is unknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge numbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several years.  There are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny deterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe polio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain. They also tend to score higher on depression scales of neuropsychologic tests.  My take on this (Im sure some will disagree):  after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or degenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing pain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads to progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS patient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe that PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than non-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but without PPS complaints). ---  .

I had a dollar or so that I gave her, and - not wanting to give away all my money to strangers (I generally give a dollar as that will buy a little food at McDonalds or something) - I offered her some ""spiritual gifts,"" as I called them, rather than gifts of money. I talked of how great I felt that God had made such a pretty day, and how nice it was to give to people - she then said she was getting married soon. She talked about how she and her husband had very little (they may not have even had a house, for all I know), but that they felt a very special love in the Lord, an unselfish kind of caring.

"       I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska Court System (sort of a justice of the peace).  I had great difficulty with that duty.  I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didnt realize that marriage is Gods institution, not the states.  Gradually, however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony, to ""please hurry it up"" may have helped me to this conclusion).        I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before God, and ""marriage"" before the state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.

As for his ""consistently over .300,"" make that ""three years in a row,  preceded by a part-time year, plus his last year, with Boston.""  Hodapp only qualified for the batting title five times.    Was he injured?  He retired right around his 28th birthday.  Anyway, Hodapp put up flashy numbers the year *everybody* put up flashy numbers.  That was his only really good year with a bat;  his other .300 years were marred by a lack of power and an inability to draw walks.  Only 163 of those 3000 PA were bases on balls, which does not describe a feared hitter.    On the other hand, he was part of the long line of famous ClevelandWambsganss, Riggs Stephenson, etc.  Roger > >Jon ""Johnny"" Hodapp >jmhodapp@aplcomm.jhuapl.edu >=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- >   ",2,rec.sport.baseball

" I recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific  brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them. Mind machines consist of LED gogles, head phones, and a microprocessor that controls them. They strobe the (closed) eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing LEDs. I understand that these devices are experimental, but they are available. Ive heard claims that they can induce sleep, and light trance states for relaxation. Essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc... I would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful, The few sources Ive seen are biased (they are selling the things, and a friend who has tried them claims that ""every home should have one""). So  do these mind machines (aka Light and Sound machines) work? can they induce alpha, theta, and/or delta waves in a person wearing them? What research if any has been done on them?

I have no first hand experience with her ability as an umpire.  But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems to me that she is missing the point and if thats how she sees the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldnt promote her either.  The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the players from trying to kill each other.   Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.    --  Dave Eisen                               ""To succeed in the world, it is not dkeisen@leland.Stanford.EDU               enough to be stupid, you must also Sequoia",2,rec.sport.baseball

Anyways, its gone now.)  The period length  is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long  as you want, IF hes still certified as injured.  The player must be  periodically re-evaluated to determine if hes still injured (thus you  cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not  wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day  that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I  believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.

Firstly, what do you exactly mean by ""fundamentalist""?  I will for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes that the bible is Gods word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened to him is what hell call being ""born again""?  Anyway, was that recent? If the answer is ""yes"" to all the questions above, it is quite understandable.  However, IMO, Ild rather give advice to your friend! I think Ive been through something similar to him, and one thing I can say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to communicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things is because they are now ""obvious"" to him.  What is ""obvious"" to him is not obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because from his point of view, he has been on ""both sides of the fence"".  This I mean that before he turned ""fundamentalist"", you two are agreeable because both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the discovery of lets say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, hes got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now. You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to you, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that risk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about, however, he may not realise that hes really putting you off.  [...]  >the Bible that it is so.

How do I convince him that I am beyond saving so he >wont try?  Thanks for any advice.  So far, Ive only been trying to explain things from his side.  However, I do understand how you feel too, because I wasnt a Christian for a good part of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or ""fundamentalists"" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their faith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately, ""religious belief"" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism is also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise), it will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both sides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what hes trying to convince you about, that its beyond you or not your concern ""for now"".  Dont tell him its nonsense, because to him it is reality - and that would be a real insult.  Hell also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too.  Like I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too. Ill admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a Christian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little differently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited and just blabbered away about what Ive found!  To me, it was too good not to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didnt really care most of the time what they thought.  You will probably think hes crazy too - but God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in mind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real to him, he doesnt see why God cant be real to you too.  I dont know how helpful this is to you.

Thats because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.  I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I deign from commenting much further.  >> Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.

Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.   >So, I think that your position>The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our  >interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out  >what that truth is. >Did I get that right?  Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The  distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, ""Cogito, ergo sum,"" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability  that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do)  abandon these absolutes.  >Whats the point of spending all this time claiming and defending  >absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we  >can never (or at least shouldnt) act upon them?  What practical  >difference can this make?  As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to  render all doubts unreasonable.  --  Virgilio ""Dean"" Velasco Jr, Department of Electrical Engg and Applied Physics  	 CWRU graduate student, roboticist-in-training and Q wannabee     ""Bullwinkle, that mans intimidating a referee!""   |    My boss is a     ""Not very well.

You can do an `acceptable job of aligning a car using simple tools and some imaginative work that would *never* have the effect of endangering anyones life.

Measure toe in, adjust to manufacturer specs. Camber a bit more difficult to adjust and measure ... I used a micrometer to measure the space between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be placed on upper and lower portions of the rim on the inside of wheel (hard to explain). This same tool could be used instead of the 2x4s.  I had made these tools up *right* after the last alignment done professionally so I had a reference that the original poster might not ...

Its the one that sometimes sweeps schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose and the brain to swell up.  It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isnt much time, however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.

I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence ""humanism""). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesnt mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified  them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of ""economics"" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was ""the free rein of the market mechanism"", while for others it was ""the dialectical forces of history"". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.

"  	The reason Im posting this article to this newsgroup is1. gather any information about this disorder from anyone who might    have recently been *e*ffected by it ( from being associated with    it or actually having this disorder ) and 2. help me find out where I can access any medical literature associated    with seizures over the internet.  Recently, I had a baby boy born with seizures which occured 12-15 hours after birth. He was immediately transferred to a major hospital in Boston and has since been undergoing extensive drug treatment for his condition. This has been a major learning experience for me and my wife not only in learning the medical problems that faced our son but also in dealing with hospitals, procedures...etc.  I dont want to go into a lot of detail, but his condition was termed  quite severe at first then slowly he began to grow and put on weight as a normal baby would. He was put on the standard anti-convulsion drugs and that did not seem to help out. His MRI, EKG, cat-scans are all normal, but the EEGs show alot of seizure activity. After many metabolic tests, body structure tests, and infection/virus tests the doctors still do not know quite what type of siezures he is having (although they do have alot of evidence that it is now pointing to infantile spasms ). This is where we stand right now....  If anyone knows of any database or newsgroup or as I mentioned up above, any information relating to this disorder I would sure appreciate hearing from you. I am not trying to play doctor here, but only trying to gather information about it. As I know now, these particular types of disorders are still not really well understood by the medical community, and so Im going to see now....if somehow the internet can at least give me alittle insight.

One has a duty to have ones marriage properly recorded and witnessed.    - But there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony   without making a genuine commitment, and therefore are not married   in Gods eyes.

However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didnt say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didnt apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5. As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they continued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile Christians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it).  Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with Gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke 7) suggest that he was a ""God-fearer"", i.e. a Gentile who followed God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such. This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the Law.  However theres more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Pauls apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isnt one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that thats not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately its an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ. Pauls comments are not the worlds clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law. It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, its important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, its not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The ""not an iota or dot"" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact thats not Jesus approach.  Jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Matdiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that reallyplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Matthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Pauls conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the ""ceremonial law"", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, hes looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causingceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.  Its unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the way terms like ""family values"" take on special meaning from the current context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why ""family values"" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term ""Law"", any more than people who concerned about the ""family values"" movement are really opposed to family values.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

I live  in fear of what will happen when I  die.     I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that Im a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.               I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.    <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.    Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  ""Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness."" For all of you ""found jeezus"" , how many of you were ""on the brink?""  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a ""non-believer"", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.

"  	The term ""stopper"" is generally used to refer to a pitcher, one who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going on a losing streak.  	The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description, although right now Id expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle.  	What the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper, somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump. Theres just no one there.  The Braves got rid of their best pure hitter, Lonnie Smith, and only Terry Pendleton on the current roster has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.

It would, however,  be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists  and then remain quiet about it.

" Hi,  I am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity. I was raised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an agnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the Christian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am happy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying to rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other relevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would like to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological works intended for a lay person?  I have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliated with any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteria should one use in choosing a church? I dont really know the difference between the various Protestant denominations.  Thanks for reading my post.   Sincerely,  Steve Hoskins  [Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an introduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Youngs NT introduction.  There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  They often have background articles that are helpful.  Probably the best recommendation these days would be Harpers Bible Commentary.  (I think there may be a couple of books with this title.  This is a fairly recent one, like about 1990, done in cooperation with the Society for Biblical Criticism.)  If you are committed to inerrancy, you will probably prefer something more conservative.  I dont read a lot of conservative books, but a commentary I looked at by Donald Guthrie looked rather good.  He has a NT Introduction, and hes also editor of Eerdmans Bible Commentary.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year at 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so far, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they shouldnt win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and the Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3 blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.  *MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth.

Outbreaks of a chronic-mono-like entity were originally called EBS (or some variant thereof) because most of the people with this disease had elevated levels of antibodies to the EBV virus. But not all of them did, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Jan. 1988, I believe). Now its also called Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs.  Astonishly, there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands, recurrent fevers and nightsweats, etc., that theres nothing wrong with them. This is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is. No one knows, but theoriespsychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most -- maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental toxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of these.

" 	Usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor uniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been incredible. 	Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms.  I remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds.   	The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOCS PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo.   	Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional. (Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties. 	With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one in the comissioners office, and inter-league play on the horizon, its nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be.

She made a >specific point to say that it was not that she had never met a good man, >since she was married to a wonderful man for a dozen years.  (Take a few >seconds and honestly ponder that thought and its implications!!!)  I have thought about the implications, and it is scary.    We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have  decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is legitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyones decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more ""deep, committed relationship.""  Marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life. Love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.  Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many  years who stayed home to care for the children because he cant be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort.    Hold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His relation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial.  My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed. If it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!) then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual relations.  Thats life...the Lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my ""needs.""    The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple ""grows apart"" seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise.  We have become so petty and small-minded that some husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the wives lose weight!  I praise the Lord for guiding me to marry my wife.  She married me anyway despite the possibility that I could have a terrible illness. And it turned out that she was the one with the brain tumor, but had I known I wouldnt have cared either.  And maybe Ill be in a car accident tomorrow and become paralyzed from the neck down. A married couple should deal with these situations with the help of the Lord, not divorce and run away from them.

By your logic, I could conclude that all of the physicians who consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to Lyme patients are doing it for the money, rather than because they believe they are encouraging good medicine.

" Regarding ""Jesus only"" believers, our moderator    [There may be some misunderstanding over terms here...]  I agree.  Quite likely, actually.                                                        [...I believe ""Jesus    only"" originally was in the context of baptism.  These are folks who    believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only    Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have    doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that    these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  Im not the    right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be    several, including what would classically be called monophysite or    Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs    that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who wont    use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply    because it is not Biblical.  --clh]  Not Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?  (earth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age."" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]  The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts contradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the Trinity the most likely explanation after all?  But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged dictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |David R. Tucker		KG2S		     drt@athena.mit.edu| ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian language as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things like ""one essense and three persons"".  Obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the term ""three-fold"" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly consistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cents.  Its unlikely that Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as Actsthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as well.)  This leaves us with sort of ato baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.  ""Jesus only"" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this consistent with Matthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  Im not the right one to ask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not appear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase ""in the name of"".)  Those who use the three-fold formula dont seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus. I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that ""in the name of"" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course theres a certain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we could just as well say that Matthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One might well suspect that in the early church, more than one baptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great damage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that I think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize mutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use ""in the name of Jesus"" now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as Ive said before, Im not the one to explain what their doctrine is.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

" This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this                          THE DOCTRINE OF GOD   I.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD      Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most      important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God.       Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should      be to know God.      I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three      Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the      Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I      believe that they are individual Persons who are one in      nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each      possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also      equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.      Cf. II.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  Gods nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without          ending.  Cf.     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,          patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa         Psa     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely          without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of          sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex.     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time          in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all          knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,          infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with          unlimited power over all creation).          God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It          is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day          has become very man-centered, and that the people in our          churches know very little about God.  I believe that the          Lords work needs to be God-centered, and that the          people of God need to understand that God is sovereign          in all         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes          regarding salvation.  III.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.      A.  In creation           All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in           creating, and all Three are active in sustaining           creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs           (for nations as well as individual people) to the end           of time.  Cf. Gen.          Heb.     B.  In salvation          In order to understand salvation I believe that it is          absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man.           All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,          active in salvation.          1.  God, the Father              Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the              Godhead determined in eternity past that there would              be salvation, the conditions under which people              could and would be saved, and even who would be              saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in              Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph         2.  Christ, the Son of God              The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the              virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two              important             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of                   God, the Father.  Cf. Col             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the                   Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on                   the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by                   His present intercessory work in heaven.  The                   work of salvation will be completed for us when                   the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom                  4; Heb         3.  The Holy Spirit              As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is              Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is              carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the              following             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new                   birth).  Cf. John             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work                   of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.              d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making                    salvation secure.  Cf. Eph             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of                   Christ.  Cf. Cor.             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of                   Scripture. Cf. John             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of                    God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12              h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal             i.   He empowers for living and for service.                     Cf.

This principle cannot be consistently applied.   I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.    The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn ""Now Thank We All Our God"" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the churchs history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.

BGSU, Bowling Green OH  43403.  Or e-mail to >clitton@andy.bgsu.edu  Thanks in advance.  I dont claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more  than most.  The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots  of a group known as the Shephards Rod.  The Shephards Rod (now  defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30s.  The Shephards Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the  SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they  were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once  in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as  Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young  adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over  the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of  weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US  government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were  putting themselves in a self defense position.    In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephards Rod, you might want to visit the  local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you  some insight into where Koresh got his theology.  Tammy ",1,soc.religion.christian

A lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  Jesus said that people would come to Him saying ""Lord, Lord,"" and proclaiming the miraculous works they had done in His name.  Jesus would tell them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know Him, and to depart from Him.    That is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual sin.  If the Holy Spirit were only given to the morally perfect, He would not be given to me, or any of us.  God can forgive any sin, if we repent.

This indicates confusion between ""proof"" and the process >of doing science.    You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make. I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the *process* of science and the end result.    As an end result of science, one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable.  But there is nothing objective about the *process* of science.    If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies, this would certainly be valuable information. But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science.  This is where you and I disagree with Turpin.  In order to have science, one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense, not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses.  Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science, but they are merely the culmination of scientific research.  The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING.   Without this, one does not have any hypotheses worth testing.  (No, hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data. Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while youre shaving or looking out the window.  At least not unless youve done a lot of really good thinking beforehand.)    The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology.   It depends on the quality of their THINKING.    It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies.

" The Phillies salvaged their weekend series against the Chicago Cubs by beating them 11-10 in a wild one at Wrigley Field Sunday afternoon.  It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young season.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2 John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny Jackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead. Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4, however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In the 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year to push the Phils ahead to stay.

(No offense, > Gordon).  I wouldnt give baserunning that much value.  The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold at third.  Thus Oleruds doubles have more advancement value than Alomars.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a double.)  Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No team in the 1950s ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players than others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well in the 1950s for all teams.    Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with 38 times caught stealing.

I dont believe the second argument, because I believe in the power of the Resurrection, the fulfillment of the Incarnation, and our hope.

If there is no God, which seems to be your current belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!

As usual, you are missing the whole point, Russell, because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.    This is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping.    If science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it would be a poor thing indeed.  What was the methodology of Darwin?  What was the methodology of Einstein?  What was, for that matter, the methodology of Jenner and Pasteur?     In an earlier article, Russell Turpin >None of the foregoing should be read as meaning that we should >open the door to practitioners of quackery and psuedo-science. >Modern advocates of homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional >Chinese medicine receive little respect because, for the most >part, they use methods and reasoning that the kind of research >Lee Lady recommends has shown to be terribly faulty.  (This does >*not* imply that all their treatments are ineffective.  It *does* >imply that those who rely on faulty methodology and reasoning are >incapable of discovering *which* treatments are effective and >which are not.)  First of all, I think you are arguing against a straw man, because I dont think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science, homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional Chinese medicine should be accepted as science.  I, in particular, think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.    What some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific attention.    If in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  For all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.    It is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  It is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on  those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous  fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.    But to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks ones attitude as doctrinaire, cultist.  This attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason.    -- In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems  less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.     lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet ",3,sci.med

" Rob Butera asks about a book called THE LOST YEARS OF JESUS, by Elizabeth Clare Prophet.  I do not know the book. However, Miss Prophet is the leader of a group (The Church Universal and Triumphant) derived from the I AM group founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930s (I am writing this from memory and may not have all the details straight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook by Marcus Bach) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared, tapped him on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of ""cosmic essence."" A major tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the mountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes every few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have been founded by monks from this monastery. Typically, the Ballard family and their successors, the Prophet family (related by marriage, if I remember aright), base almost all their teachings on messages they have allegedly received by telepathy from Tibet.

There are some who dont want to turn over everything and be a disciple, some have no clue about it because theyve not been taught, some have done exactly that and turned over everything to follow Jesus, some are blocked by difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law. However, Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his disciple in Lukepeople ignore the command and treat it as optional?  I certainly dont have an answer to this.

As for these attacking responses, I must say that I disagree with your tone and what appears to be some very judgmental statements (possibly to the point of slander) when talking about people, not what they do.  Please, if you have a response, state it instead of flying off the handle on some discourse which may have nothing truly to do with what is being discussed.  Im sure both Dan and I would have a much happier time with your responses.  Joe ",1,soc.religion.christian

I am a picky eater and never wanted to  try chinese food, however, I finally tried some in order to please a girl I was seeing at the time.  I had never heard of Chinese restaurant syndrome.  A group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different dishes.  It didnt taste great, but I decided it wasnt so bad.  We went home and went to bed early.  I woke up at 2 AM and puked my guts outs. I threw up for so long that (Im not kidding) I pulled a muscle in my tongue.  Dry heaves and everything.  No one else got sick, and Im not allergic to anything that I know of.    Suffice to say that I wont go into a chinese restaurant unless I am  physically threatened.  The smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is* a psycholgical reaction).  When I have been dragged in to suffer through beef and broccoli without any sauces, I insist on no MSG.   I havent gotten sick yet.  --  Doug Bank                       Private Systems Division dougb@ecs.comm.mot.com          Motorola Communications Sector dougb@nwu.edu                   Schaumburg, Illinois dougb@casbah.acns.nwu.edu       708-576-8207                     ",3,sci.med

The valet key can be left with someone and will NOT unlock the trunk or enable the cable release.

The runner can leave his base at any time.  If the ball is caught, hes got to tag up.  If it isnt caught, he _doesnt_ have to tag up at all.  So, if hes feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for glory as soon as the ball is popped up.  If it isnt caught, hes probably scored a run.  If it is, hes probably headed for AAA.    	The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out, thereby removing the force on the runners on base.  All other rules apply, as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up.  --  Tim Shippert                                 shippert@cco.caltech.edu ""If we are going to stick to this damned quantum-jumping, then I regret that I ever had anything to do with quantum theory."" 					-E.

"  I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly, (motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here. I generally dont take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because Ive found them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much worse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past (~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back.  Ive tried Synarel, it reduced the pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately after I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only ""real solution"" to my problem.  Although I dont expect to have any more children, I dont like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children.  So basically all Im left with is toughing out the pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something similar - but not aspirin, that doesnt work, and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago, so Im through with it).  In fact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both  legs) as Ill discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain (its actually quite effective at reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime Im frequently in severe pain.  The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy.  Ive had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs (Ive had 2 of them, and dont intend to ever do that again) with nerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have several bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think) it is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations. The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test, called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the ""internal nerves"" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain is there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there, I need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so Id  always resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently, and primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month or so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier, but it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at a lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going away (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I dont have nearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago.  Getting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches, I really cant avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources, that ""force"" me to use them (Oh, I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery, but Im avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with, occassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at a reduced capacity (Im a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I cant concentrate much, I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because the pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can cause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad I cant really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot of migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days. Ive taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage), but I dont like the side effects (if I take more than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will eventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasnt very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan becomes available, I should try that.  Ive tried several other medications (fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but they either didnt work, or I couldnt tolerate them.  So what can I do? My doctors seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of pain.  Ive had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine), and Ive already had surgery several times.  Anyway, the point of what Im saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.  Janice Rathmann  ",3,sci.med

By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend Gods rich love   to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope   and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His    acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired)    everywhere?

To this, the Mother  ""Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word."" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many? Our Holy Mother  ""The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or    anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.""  Although the Holy Mother does not insist  ""You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you."" but she follows this  ""You are surprised because I say to  you have lived this day."" Why does she constantly  ""Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself   in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray"" or one time when we    decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother  ""Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from   my peace plan and prayer.""  (Rev  and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep   Gods commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for Gods current messenger of true peace, love and   our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils   that the serpent brings upon us?  This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Havent there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever   this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her   in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christs   ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient   harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart. The new Eden as sanctuary (the womb) for the next coming and judgement of the    righteous by our Lord, Jesus Christ; when The Lamb marries His bride. Shouldnt we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the   second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear   the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary   faithfully brings to Gods children?  She has been protecting the flock   (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more    righteous members for her Sons coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy   of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course,   approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and   divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the   Scripture.     Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our  ""If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear   God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.""   She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant  faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions,  but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Lets not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there wont be enough time or when it will be late.                                                        Nowadays, Mary says,  ""Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children."" Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.""                                                                          And you think shes just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  Shes our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share Gods kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.

Koberg,  	Just a couple of minor corrections here...  	1)  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in tongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to Pentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.  	2)  Im not sure what you mean by ""signifying believers""  but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian.  The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is ""Baptized in the Holy Spirit""  That may be what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about ""these signs following them that believe"" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you dont pactice the signs you arent ""saved"".  	3)  I know its hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but I think youve made some pretty big generalizations here.  Do ""Neo-Pentecostals"" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message?  Ive never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.

As time goes on we have to >rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to God becuase >science is removing our props.  I dont think this is a bad thing. > 	First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all, although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lords existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.  	My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride Gods decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have  children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.  	People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on Gods wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.  	This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely  prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary  alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,   go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?  	I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will sayuniverse to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to  believe their search is displeasing to God.  			---Malcusco ",1,soc.religion.christian
" Ive been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington,  I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of  etymology.  Ive been reflecting on what certain words meant in my  childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.   I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very  angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It  carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some  time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ and  `Christian.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To  become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would  consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared  to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a  better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable  riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that  they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time  they had decided it wasnt a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They  didnt disown me but they didnt completely accept the situation either.   For example, they didnt come to my wedding because it was in a church.    When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her  death, she said to me, ""As far as Im concerned, you still are a Jew.""  What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a  Jew.  I am a Christian.  (Ill concede, one that likes chicken soup with  matzoh I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My  sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who  do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people  Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their  experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while  following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.    I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.   It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have  a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small  sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it  and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I dont have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.   I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the  Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is  that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again,  being rooted in the past.   This is probably one of the reasons why I dont like it when people mess  around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of  Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.  I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldnt assume that all  believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish  Christian is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron.   Jayne Kulikauskas/jayen@mmalt.guild.org ",1,soc.religion.christian

I disagree.  People marry each other.  When they commit fully to each other as life partners, they are married.  The ceremony may assist in emphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing. God knows our hearts.  He knows when two have committed themselves to be one, he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully giving ourselves to another.

This >also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of >David as according to at least Roman law (and possibly Mosaic law as >well, but I am not sure) Joseph was Christs LEGAL FATHER.  The argument for Lukes genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According to Luke    And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about     thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,    the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possibleClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Marys genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husbands, from Davids son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from Davids son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew    And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born    Jesus, who is called Christ.   There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesuss physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesuss messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesuss divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Josephs seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not ""known""each other).  Thus the first gospels dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating  the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and  the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two  stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of ""how this could be"" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiners ""The Spiritual Guidance of the Human  Being and of Humanity"", ""The Gospel of St. Luke"", and ""The Gospel of St. Matthew"".   Whether or not Rudolf Steiners methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of ones Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Marys Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king.  Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com) ",1,soc.religion.christian

Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christs message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences.  The Bibles message is that we are to love all people, and that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.  One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.  Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live, if it wasnt for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion (I wont name any here, though one comes to mind) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects.  Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power, greed and hatred.  Please dont point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in love for others.  Yours in Christ,  Andrew McVeigh   p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time again.  -- *****   Andrew McVeigh ",1,soc.religion.christian

There are many organisms, viral, bacterial, and fungal, which can cause meningitits, and the course of these infections varies widely. The causes of bacterial meningitis vary withpneumococcus (the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia) is the most common cause, while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause.  What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis, which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups, but with lower incidence in infants. This organism is also called the ""meningococcus"", and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press. Without prompt treatment (and even WITH it in some cases), the organism typically causes death within a day.   This organism, feared as it is, is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults. It can get to the meninges by different ways, but blood borne spread is probably the usual case.   Rifampin (an oral antibiotic) is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis, by the way.  Sorry, but I dont have time for a more detailed reply. Meningitis is a huge topic, and sci.med cant do it justice.   -km ",3,sci.med

We Catholics do believe that Gods revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church. It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as Sacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions. However, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can be added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed before the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at any subsequent council.  Cardinal Newmans _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_, written while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of of this point.

If this is true than why in the Genesis story is God concerned that Adam and Eve might also eat from the Tree of Life and live forever and be like gods?

Is there any reason to assume that they had already eaten of the Tree of Life and so had already attained to eternal life?  If so, what basis is there for saying that this was taken away from them?

The older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.  Two major differences in the running gear (that Im aware of) need study. My 79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. Im not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system. The older Landcruisers have a ""lock-up"" type. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.  	Paul Hovnanian	hovnania@atc.boeing.com 	[Std disclaimers apply] ",0,rec.autos

This is >an issue that may be very personal, but is important.  What does >the Bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with >regard to this issue?  This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much, and probably has not been studied much.  As some of you may be aware, Ive posted a lot of articles lately on personality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up to speed, just read alt.psychology.personality and/or ask for by personality type summary file.  One observation is that people have significantly different personalities (no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.  My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and create environments that scare away many who are naturally introverted (there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am quite introverted in preference, and find the pressure by many churches to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very uncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing. (BTW, theres nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both preferences have their place in the Body).  Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is excerpted from my 1.  Energizing - How a person is         Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside                           world of people, activities or things.          Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from ones internal                           world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.   Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the Body of Christ, instead of trying to change peoples personalities to fit them into a particular framework.  Im sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all.  Jon Noring  --   Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

" Heres the life of St. MAria Goretti, posted with kind permission of the editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine ""Morning Star"".  Hope you like it.      Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti        Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,     the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful     girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but     one     The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on     the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-     nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally     arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and     give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon     on	the  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love     we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to     die rather than commit a mortal sin.      Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy     Eucharist.	Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her fathers     absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the	rest  of  the     day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is     until  				   -4-            her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.     Thus ended the happiest day of Marias life.      Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling     little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her     mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,	Maria     took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.     She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the     Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Gorettis, owning     a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other     children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she     did the Holy Will of God.      During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)	twice     made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On     both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandros     strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she     even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria	lived     in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.       On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  ""get  a     handkerchief,""  as	he  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath     the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the     baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered     what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a     91/2""  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told     him she wouldnt go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He     stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia     instantly realized what he was up to. ""No, No, No! Do  not	touch     me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!"" At this point Alessandro     held the knife over Marias chest, who was now on the floor.      ""Will you or will you not?"" Maria gathered all her energy.	""No I     will  not,	Alessandro,  no!""   She had chosen her martyrdom over     sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the     knife  into   Marias  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to     his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the     knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying     of the baby Teresa	on  the  landing  brought  the	attention  to     Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended     and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find     Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.     When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   ""He     wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.""      The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro	away.     As	the  ambulance	carried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd     followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for     poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First     Communion  				   -5-            came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.     He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  ""Yes.

Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Marias  death  but     because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in     prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-     ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of     a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to     him.

If Bob >increases his teams chance of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs, that does >not mean that Bob increased his teams chance of winning by 400%.  In fact, >it doesnt mean *anything*, because the units are screwy.  I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400% does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious positive association between Johns statistic and winning games.  Thus, before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must go into what sort of relationship there is.  >Consider an>about .12 on your scale.

So Fred and Bob combined have >amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  Theres clearly a problem here.  The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a player who gets an out gets a ""negative probability"" in most cases. Thus, Im not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes, they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also, the pitchers bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.      >>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the >>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs >>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming. >>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough. > >In another article, I proposed a test of this.

If >late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at >late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?  No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score  in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.         >Heres another thought>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost >exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play. >Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with >no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who  >scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero. > >Does this make sense?   No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look, if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers, fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a ""negative chance"" that the team would win.   From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda. At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance goes down.  Ive never seen convincing proof that this really happens. So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15% on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%. I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.  How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, Ks, BBs, etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better  pitcher?  They were probably about the same.                                                          Brian Smith ",2,rec.sport.baseball
" I seldom see any posts in this group. Is anyone out there in Christendom listening? If so, why dont we get some dialog going here?  Heres a topic to get things started. My daughters Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.   What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.   Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption is drawing near. Look up!  [Postings are in the range of 30 to 50 per day, except weekends.

The odds that you are going to find some miracle with your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge for this or any other disease are slim.

Until then, spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical problem may divert that energy from more productive things in life.  A limited amount should be spent to assure yourself that your doctor gave you the correct story, but after it becomes clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine has no good solution, perhaps the best strategy is to join the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to make a career out of it.  --  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Gordon Banks  N3JXP      | ""Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and geb@cadre.dsl.pitt.edu   |  it is shameful to surrender it too soon.""  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ",3,sci.med

This disease is  universally and usually rapidly fatal.  After diagnosis in June 1992, the  tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  The forum  member checked extensively on Dr. Burzynkis track record for this disease.   He spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from  glioblastoma following this treatment and to an NCI oncologist who had  audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.   After the forum members father began Dr. Burzynskis treatment in  September, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his  oncologist in Chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of  shrinkage or necrosis.  The patients oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live  past December 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying Dr. Burzynskis  treatment.  Since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under Dr. Burzynskis  treatment, shes since changed her attitude toward continuing these  treatments, saying ""if it aint broke, dont fix it.""  Dr. Burzynski is an M.D., Ph.D. with a research background who found a  protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it,  and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.

Im really looking forward to seeing this cant-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was only 21 or 22 (cant remember).  But who did the Sox have at first? Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was there.  Sure, I say go for it.  I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/ Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.  BTW, I dont think Thomas was hurt by those three months.      >Or Cal Eldred wasnt *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?  Well, if we cant compare our guy to one of the best in the game, lets compare our decision to one of the most ""Boneshead"", right?  Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a longer minor league career.  Frankly, I dont know why he didnt make the club in 1992.

" Desiree Bradley (Desiree_Bradley@mindlink.bc.ca) asked us whether we should think of the Serbs as doing Gods work in Bosnia.  Ive refrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say something.  Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break down these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If Moslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we dont kill them.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions. There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully.  The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two different things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into Canaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be a holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were expected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of agreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war.  The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldnt see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldnt have doctors or hospitals because illness is Gods judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God for good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesnt justify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that in attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as *unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack Gods people, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were actually carrying out Gods plan didnt excuse their action. Furthermore, we shouldnt conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through his prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to Bosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting, I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that doesnt justify it, and it wont save the people who are doing it from judgement.  I am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue because of current tensions between the West and Moslem-oriented nations.  What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude that Christians think its OK to kill Moslems.  The implications for the mid-East, and even relations with American Moslems, could be quite serious.

" Mark Ashleys account of private revelation does not, as some might think, contradict my posting in which I said that the Catholic Church believes that public revelation, on which Catholic doctrine is based, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  In that posting I made sure I used the word ""public"".  Public revelation contains Gods truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not.  When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)  I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation--its not something I need every day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation ------- Marty Helgesen ""What if there were no such thing as a hypothetical situation?""

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldnt give her the ""bimbo"" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what ""we"" wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the ""let me run this price by the sales manager"".  After playing the ""good salesman, bad salesman"" game, we finally told him that if he didnt have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book.  (Read Remar Suttons ""Dont Get Taken Every Time"" for a list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of ""youll have to work with us on this price"", also known as ""each time you come up a thousand dollars well come down ten"", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said ""well, we cant come down any more so I guess we cant help you"" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesmans office all by ourselves.  Hmm. Id read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from ""his"" phone!  I said that since hed announced that our business was over, he shouldnt care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom. Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again.  We say that we wont bother him anymore, were going next door to the Nissan dealership.  Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom, customers and all, ""Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!"" So my friend bought a Sentra.  Just so the guilty wont go unpunished, Ill mention that the sales managers name was Gary Tusone.  From his manner, his refusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the end, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who was a young novice) that hed be able to get at least X dollars out of us, and he was steamed that we wouldnt fall for his slimy tricks.

[text deleted] >Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* >careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for  >sin.    I wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions. I havent seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here).  I myself wrote that when you dont do things Gods way that curses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of curse is retribution, I only meant harm or misfortune when I used the word.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his Bible.  God doesnt cause curses, he warns us of them.  Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago): >Last week I was guilty of anger, jealousy, and whole mess of >other stuff, yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with >AIDs.  To even suggest that AIDS is ""deserved"" is ludicrous.  The Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is much worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.  Paul Conditt reveals his>In case you couldnt tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when >I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and >phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other >socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through >their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus...  The first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is ""obvious""ly wrong to be angry (Galwhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was ""forgive them Father, they know not what they do.""  Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Him.  Please dont give in to anger, it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.  Its okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to address it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others dont then I would frame a response something like ""It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is Gods punishment for people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the opportunity to accept Gods grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts, believing the gospels testimony, repenting of our sin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life for him.  Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  Gods arm is not to short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him.""  The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that havent been expressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.  You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.  The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved.  The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to Gods commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways, is to listen to Gods advice and have sex only with your wife or husband.

Reproduced without permission.]    Digression Although the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically tasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle berries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile,  Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle berry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids  (which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste sour as well.  Miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin pill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such substances would taste sweet without providing many calories.  A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries. We drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted extremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We  awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.

Before you post a text in reply investigate its context.  First of all, ""ceremonial law"" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be  a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  Paul writes in Collosionsagainst us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is ""sabbaton"" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption ""the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law"" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because ""the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.""  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal  statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?  Link Hudson. ",1,soc.religion.christian

By far the (still) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned physical examination. If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down  into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra-abdominal pressure.... Sometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only  detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal.  Whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous operation, I cant tell you.

Those are the arguments against Lopez for the >>Braves for this year.  >>Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid >>abilities to call games, to work with the pitchers, to throw out >>runners.    	This is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both the SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catchers defense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls in the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various catchers rank in ""defense"".    	Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves (or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I can tell he doesnt have any particular problem in his mechanics (such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to clear that up is playing and practice time.  I cant see how repetitions at AAA are any better then reps in the majors!    	All were left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping the pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost all veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn the major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to learn Tom Glavines pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldnt be supprised if the pitchers claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But  given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.  	Now, since Lopez cant learn how to handle the major league pitchers while hes in AAA and since he doesnt have any glaring problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he cant learn just as well while in the majors?

And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus himself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than heaven itself.

Preaching the Gospel  >without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a  >clanging cymbal.  Yes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to extremes before stopping at ""moderation.""  I think we have seen the extreme of the ""hell fire & brimstone"" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones sensibilities.  I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a story.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the point of telling him that he didnt believe in Satan or hell.  He believed everybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to pray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man wouldnt do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they dont believe in hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesnt exist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didnt exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And yet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.  Id use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it.  When I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that isnt called, oi vey!.  Whats with that ref that he didnt make that call.  Its unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which is still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness which includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life, then broad is the way to distruction.  > >Heres a>afraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to Gods love?  I think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all, repentance isnt only a turning towards, but also a turning away from! No, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we should do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.    I have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its eternality.  1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness. 2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.    If responsible, then he is also accountable. 3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God. 4) Christ.

" Being a parent in need of some help, I ask that you bear with me while I describe the situation which plagues me...  I am a divorced father. Chance would have it that ""my weekend"" with my  daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.  Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.  During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.   When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she  be baptised as Catholic. This wasnt a problem with me.  During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated ""effectively"".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for  Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to ""drive her from the fold"", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.  Any suggestions?  If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (Im not a regular reader of this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)  Thanks, and I hope youve had a happy Easter.

First somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing. Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him. (As well as by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read his work.)  Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his introduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Why? Although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- ""a great coward.""   OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by Lewis liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is part of a *much* bigger discourse.) I would just like to add that, far from being embarrassed by Lewis, I am in a state of continual amazement at the soundness and clarity of the arguments he presents.   - Phil -  Hey, were talking about the PHONE COMPANY, here.

The Bible ""ends"" with the book of Revelations. But does Gods reign end there ? No. So who can say for sure that Gods messages are either no longer happening or still happening ?  I can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-) With the cold response Ive gotten from the past from this group, its very hard to get the point across. Ill only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere. Ive cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before. Theyre still there. 8-) The apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show Gods existence. That was the spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several countries. That event is ""approved"" by the Pope. Currently, images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa are showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under investigation by the Church. But realize that investigations take decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come in ten days, thats a bit too late, isnt it 8-). Other events under investigation are inner locutions (""coming to know""), stigmata (the person exhibits Christs wounds. And they dont heal. And doctors dont know why). Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, Im sure.  This stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M or God will call me home). Its free. Find out why theyre happening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody can figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion. If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned. These are not ""members only"" events. God and Mary invites  everybody.  So in conclusion (finally) ... We RCs believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary. We are scared to death sometimes although were told not to. There are more proofs and events. And that is why ""not everything is in the Bible"". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told to read the Bible.  As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned... In the end, Gods churches will unite. Im not sure how. I have some idea. But the point is we shouldnt worry about the ""versus"" part. Just do Gods work. Thats all that matters. Unity will come.

"  I may not be the worlds greatest expert on chiggers (a type of mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years (since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from painful   1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.      Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more      sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.    2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear      that these things will itch for months.    3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of      it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,      since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could      find on the subject was a *single* book in UNCs special      collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is      required to get it.    4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old      folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesnt work.  I recall      reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers      burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I      think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some      sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.    5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.      A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally      applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is      another preparation called ""Chig Away"" that is a combination of      sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was      prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In      the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get      up on weekends since I literally cant go outside where we      live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They      apparently dont like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur      as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)    6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget      the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment      that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone      creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine      (relieves the itch).  I wont tell you all the things Ive tried.      Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this      counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think      it gains nothing).    7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved      by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery      as well.  Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban doctors apparently dont encounter them much.  And the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a *lot* of money. --  Gary H.

[ . . . ]  Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the Catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting their rosary beads during Mass, I find this comment interesting.  There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is its being chanted by threein the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isnt a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to ""get em in and get em out"".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasnt follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.} --                                                      --- Tim Rolfe                                                  rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu                                                  rolfe@junior.dsu.edu                                                 RolfeT@columbia.dsu.edu ",1,soc.religion.christian
"    Heres how I talk to non-Christians who are complaining about Hell.   The point is that Heaven is based on faith--if you dont believe in heaven, theres no way youre going to be in it.   Of course, the next step is, ""I dont believe in Hell either, so why will I be there?""  It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God. Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and never see God--so they do, in fact, believe that theyre going to Hell.   Hell doesnt have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because its eternal,  and its a lot worse than Heaven.  Thats the only comparison that matters.

Note also, that if Im describing a (hypothetical) death of a friend as a result of his passion for fast motorcycles, I might say ""his mother predicted he would die.""  Of course, his father may have said ""he ll make good money because of his hobby"" and depending upon the final outcome of the situation I end up mentioning the one thats relevant.  A reader down the road will get the impression that the mother or father had predicted accurately the event, when it was just a casual statement.  Finally, on prophesies, note that there are many prophesies that can be fulfilled my people, often to fool believers.  If I say, ""Beware, the terminal will unexpectedly be shut off!"" and then after 2 secs I turn it off (or have someone come out from another room and do it) there was no prediction.  A similar situation arises with the establishment of the Jewish state.  While pressing for it, prominent Jews argued that it was predicted that theyd have a state again, and that the time has come.  (Ive read this somewhere, but cant think of the source - if you can, please let me know.)  In this case, the establishment of the state does not really fulfill the  prophesy since the prophesy was used in order to push for the establishment of the state.  Deciding what was truely a fulfillment of prophesy is very tricky.  -leo  --  ""My mother wanted to save herself until marriage.  Every |Leonidas Hepis day I thank God that she didnt.

My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldnt* go that fast, but that they *shouldnt* go that fast.  A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesnt suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine.  Thats what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine.  They didnt even bother improving the *brakes.*  The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when youre invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didnt have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be 1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than    they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have    speed limits that arent out-of-line with what we used to have in    the US -- if my friends werent lying to me theyre typically not    much higher than 120km/h.  I strongly suspect you wont find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.

In comparison, in  the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall  decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in  gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of  this disease from 1985 through 1992.       In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department  of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992,  reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively  (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics  (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases  with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7%  of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by  age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or  equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all  reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the  largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age  group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).       Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver  metropolitan area (1990state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area  occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods  considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.       When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among  men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in  the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits  by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases  diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men,  the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised  94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among  self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992,  respectively).       Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO,  university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted  to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea  culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased  23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the  fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).       From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and  Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado  increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992,  the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for  whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000)  (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from  1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases  increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups.

Editorialmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more  complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH  surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea  cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories  suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact.  However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning  laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the  gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.       One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in  Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a  recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs  (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area  coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires  further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated  previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6)  -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom  gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs,  and gang affiliation.       The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the  national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective  19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for  gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at  greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race- specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as  socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.       In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado,  interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting  partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at  increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black  males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in  schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted  primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to  perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational  interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of  members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders  and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety  belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50  states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety  belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by  an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major  cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of  occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for  those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In  addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to  use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between  adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints  for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC  analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this  study.       Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to  18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based,  random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury  Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499  (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent  was asked to specify the childs age and the frequency of restraint use for  that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in  this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than  consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up).  Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software  for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates  and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined  by p values of less than 0.05.       Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six  (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no  law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania,  and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a  vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse  of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary  enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a  safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states  used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use.  The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law  requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law  (no-law states).       Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not  consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and  adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square  test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus  43.2%, respectively).       High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1  year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than  consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported  high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the childs age  (adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child- occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of  consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult  safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age  groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).       Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded  that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition,  higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with  increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated  with increased adult safety-belt use (8).   ReportedCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC.   Editorialindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely  to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these  nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit  other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater  risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).       Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with  child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs  should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low  educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such  programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve  low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are  directed at parents with young children.       Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In  addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment,  those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do  not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety  belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and  safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may  increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers --  the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the  highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

Description ofand the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population- based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The  prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983- 1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan  Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race,  sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the  kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general  diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand  limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are  probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these  defects are relatively easy to diagnose.termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However,  the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be  related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene  pool, or random variation.       Actionscollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in  the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on  the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received  throughout the year.viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency  overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted  over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices  of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were  similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of  identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype  increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the  1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were  reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza  A(H1N1).influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the  importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since  amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.       Actionsthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make  informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                   High Tech Assisted Reproductive Technologies  Following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF- ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been  developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT),  embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together,  these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive  technology (ART) procedures.   Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or  pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility  management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to  proceed with one of the ART procedures.   Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility  service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and  Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in  ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients  in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the  traditional therapies.   The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our  Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the  realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included o in vitro  o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube    transfer  o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation.  This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed  towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then  subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA  amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization.   There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by  other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and  hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ  hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of  which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit  sex-linked disorders.   The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that  it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility  of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth  of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our  Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of  unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and  the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred  to the patients uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under  strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being  processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our  andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-  HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to  perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically  stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing  hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo  lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs  obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic  egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia,  we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our  Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.        Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal  deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male  factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall  success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per  cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173  IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.       Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is  disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological  factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well  recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous  ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle  attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant  of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an  Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of  traditional therapies.       The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not  been clearly delineated beyond recognitionavailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates  significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years;  and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is  unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our  Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may  be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that  fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant  proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently,  the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our  program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs  of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.        GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room,  usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves  introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian  tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization  occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF,  with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for  transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in   HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26 Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993  which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such  pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility  and/or idiopathic infertility.          The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990  indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained  with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36  percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might  expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our  program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while  substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the  patient. These concernsa procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing  general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from  obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs,  and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.       The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial  environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between  January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT  cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.       Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when  embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos.  This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for  success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical  issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated  by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from  both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs  should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.       Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new,  is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but  who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in  combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10  percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the  procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under  the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm  through enzymatic digestion.       Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10  percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly  relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm.  Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques  for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such  efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology  offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to  establish conception.

Fuel injector  cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on the solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is pricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent itself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to fit your system and do it yourself, but I didnt tell you that... :-)  Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a  discussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron (not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best.

" Id like to share my thoughts on this topic of ""arrogance of Christians"" and look forward to any responses.  In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the truth.  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade A kid would say, ""All policemen are jerks!""  Id ask, ""How do you know?""  ""Because my daddy told me so!""  ""How do you know youre daddy is right?""  ""He says hes always right!""  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, arent we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as false?  -------------  This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I apologize if Im covering tired old ground.  Some of the discussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome any comments.  | Louis J.

I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say theres not enough evidence to believe it, or that theres just as good evidence for other religions.  I dont agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who dont find the evidence convincing.  But that doesnt seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things thats rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but theres no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a ""historical"" religion.  That is, its based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the ""mundane"" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesnt).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope were all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I dont see how else we could proceed.  This neednt result in arrogance.  Im certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they dont, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But its got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.  --clh] ",1,soc.religion.christian

So your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences (since this is the only other source of information left to us). How can you then convince somebody that your ""feelings and experiences"" are the correct ones then if you cant show somebody visible and measurable effects?  If my experiences say that ""there exists no god"" and yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only going on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal realities.  Furthermore, the trouble with ""feelings and experiences"" is that they can lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I am sure that many of Koreshs followers really believed in him but I think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.  Finally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical sphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?  > Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence,  > which they call faith, and which is a gift of God.

You must be using a definition of ""evidence"" that I am not familiar with. To me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that what you are saying is true.  However, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith. It is not something you can share around - others must experience it independantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this puts belief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christians do not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of these things can go.  > In a previous article, phs431d@vaxc.cc.monash.edu.au ()>  >>You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.

At the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously,  the trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEY claim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists it should read ""for explaining the non-existence of God"").  So not only must you ""prove"" your own case, you have to ""disprove"" theirs.

I know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they dont. I just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.

" This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique Id never seen before.  He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil. The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray, made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.  In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.  On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.  Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises and concerns me 1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?  2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color     (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring     agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected     it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,     caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being     used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?  3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated     as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract     from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever     happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea     could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do     so.  WRT natural wood smoke (Ive smoking a duck right now, as it happens), Ive noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips, getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process, then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.  My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff, just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?  I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.  And yet another reason Ive heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  Im pretty sure this claim actually has some standing, dont know about the others.  An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it was discovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting a lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils. This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic. The guy who represented the company in the press conference defended himself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal- broiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, my immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal broiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans! ",3,sci.med

" Chris Mussack > For all those people who insist I question How 	The Holocaust 	The Spanish Inquisition 	Jonestown  (just to name a few) ?  Authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things.  People who ""just follow orders"" have tortured and killed others in very large numbers, and protest their innocence afterwards.  When your authority starts telling you to do things, you should ask questions.  Except for situations of pressing need (""I said shut the hatch because the submarine is filling with water!""), any reasonable authority should be able to give at least some justification that you can understand.  Just be sure to listen when authority answers.  (If anybody is interested in questions of psychological pressure and  following orders, you might want to read about a study done by Solomon Ashe  in 1951 on conformity, and another done by Stanley Milgram in 1963 on  obedience.  Both should be in any good book on psychology/sociology.  The  results are both fascinating and terrifying.)

Ive wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years now; came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead (biggest mistake of my life!)  Anyway, for $4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit. The most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the engine and passenger compartment.  Also look for chassis welded together here.  Oh yeah, the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger; a 6 (if you could find one) would be mucho more bucks.  Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by (for an old car) and you can even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too.  The machine itself is pretty simple (they use the spare tire for windshild washer instead of a pump fer chris sake!) so getting it fixed by a good bug/porsche mechanic would be easy.

I dont know if this is believeing blindly or not. Im not sure how blindness comes into it. I do not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory).   Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence,  which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The  evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning on the evidence of the senses wont help either. But Christians do reason of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the evidence of these other senses is part of Gods revelation of himself to us.  It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense, belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.  >You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if >we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And since >we can only use faith, why is one picture of ""God"" (e.g. Hinduism) any less >valid than another (e.g. Christianity)? > Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source  of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.  If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty. --  ============================================================================== Mark Baker                  | ""The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but  aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts."" -- C.
