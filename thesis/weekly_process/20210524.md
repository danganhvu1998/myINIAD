## Done last week

+ Speed up process by using
  + Cache
    + Using map with complexity of O( log(N) )
    + Result:

    ```
        Cache only 10e3 nodes, 5 * 10e5 edges

        real    0m5.416s // 2m40.334s
        user    0m4.087s
        sys     0m0.455s

        Redis access: 
            GET: 13000
            SET: 13000
            TOTAL: 26022
    ```
  + Bulk request

    ```
        Cache with bulk get 10e3 nodes, 5 * 10e5 edges
        
        real    0m1.989s
        user    0m1.686s
        sys     0m0.138s

        Redis access: 
            GET: 3824
            SET: 13000
            TOTAL: 16846

        Cache with bulk get 10e5 nodes, 5 * 10e7 edges
        
        Calculate with 4 rounds:
        real   3m9 .890s
        user    2m46.728s
        sys     0m5.131s

        Redis access: 
            GET: 3104037824
            SET: 400000
            TOTAL: 504041

    ```
+ Currently about 20 slowers compare with normal pagerank with no Redis. 
+ Currently using about 625MB of ram for 10e5 nodes and 5 * 10e7 edges
+ Add test to make sure each part do its job well
+ Add level of debug to easier findout problems

## Problems

+ When have about > 10e3 nodes, with normal pagerank only need 3-5 rounds to have the accuracy 0.00001. The version using redis need much more rounds. Not yet able to find the reason
  + 1000 nodes, normal page rank need 3 rounds, version with redis need 12
  + 10e5 nodes, normal page rank need 4 rounds, version with redis need 20+ rounds (cancel as it ran for too long.)
  
## In process

+ Setup 2 worker sync with each other to complete Page Rank using redis as storage.
+ Find out why when using redis, it need to run more rounds

## Todo Next week

+ Continue on in process work

## Reminder
+ How much data is sent via network
+ Volume computing reduce after adding a node
+ Add reason why use redis
