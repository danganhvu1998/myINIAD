### Reason for using redis

Main reason for using redis is at the same time, it can be use both for data storage purpose, and communication purpose. Probably it might be faster if use local ram only, but there is problems how to access these ram to get needed data for other worker while running? And it is very likely that even if it is possible, all the process needed in the end might actually even slower than redis itself.

+ It can serve at the same time as data reader and communicator
  + Data Reader: For local worker to access and 
  + Communicator: Allow other workers to access via the Internet to access data
+ How a worker gets all needed data:
  + Check local cache
  + If the data about a node is not found in cache, check ip address of in charged worker and ask its redis for data(possibly locally)

## Done last week

+ Communicator using c_socket (Realized that we dont actually need it)
  + First receive request from other workers in form of redis command
  + Execute redis command using local redis
  + Return the answer for that workers
+ Still there is problems Client re-send last message when disconnect.

## In process

+ Setup 2 computer to execute page rank for soc-LiveJournal1 dataset. (3M nodes, 60M edges)
+ Edge partition (Using a modification of [Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem))

## Reminder

+ Pay attention to network volume
