## Done last week

+ Using `hiredis/hiredis.h` for C++ (Originally for C only)
+ Using redis as storage for page rank
  + Normal Page Rank (10e3 Nodes, 5*10e5 Edges)
    ```
    ~/gitRepo/myINIAD/thesis/cpp/page_rank$ time ./pageRank 

    real    0m0.145s
    user    0m0.131s
    sys     0m0.008s
    ```
  + Page rank with redis (10e3 Nodes, 5*10e5 Edges)
    ```
    ~/gitRepo/myINIAD/thesis/cpp/page_rank_with_redis$ g++ pageRank.cpp -o a.out -lhiredis && time ./a.out 

    real	2m40.334s
    user	0m19.272s
    sys 	1m9.298s
    ```
    + Redis Access:
      + GET: 6008346
      + SET: 13000
      + TOTAL COMMAND: 6034346 (Including DEL)
  
## Inprocess

+ Setup 2 worker sync with each other to complete Page Rank using redis as storage.
+ Bulk access for redis to improve time

## Todo Next week

+ Continue on in process work

## Reminder
+ How many times access redis
+ How much data is sent via network
+ Volumn computing reduce after adding a node
